weird i never thought the govmint would get into funding this you know weapons of mass destruction etc etc september senate committee passes nanotech bill by roy mark the senate commerce committee unanimously passed on thursday legislation to promote nanotechnology research and development introduced by sen ron wyden dore the st century nanotechnology research and development act would create the national nanotechnology research program the bill is cosponsored by sen joe lieberman dconn and sen george allen rva the proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would support longterm nanoscale research and development and promote effective education and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers and professionals the unanimous support of the senate commerce committee is a very big step forward for this very small technology lieberman who vowed to pushed to full senate passage before the end of the year said nowhere in the world are the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of nanotechnology the us certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to lead the world in developing this technology our legislation will provide the nation with a longterm focus and sustained commitment and facilitate new collaborations between government academia and industry that will ensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation the bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology program under the national science and technology council it would also create a presidential national nanotechnology advisory panel and national nanotechnology coordination office which would provide administrative and technical support for the advisory panel and the council my own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to change america on a scale equal to if not greater than the computer revolution i am determined that the united states will not miss but will mine the opportunities of nanotechnology wyden said in introducing the bill at present efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a halfdozen federal agencies i want america to marshal its various nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the worlds leader in this burgeoning field and i believe federal support is essential to achieving that goal to study the potential longterm effects of nanotechnology a new center for societal ethical educational legal and workforce issues related to nanotechnology would also be established according to lieberman the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the national research council nrc which completed a thorough review of the national nanotechnology initiative in june those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel emphasizing longterm goals striking a balance between longterm and shortterm research supporting the development of research facilities equipment and instrumentation creating special funding to support research that falls in the breach between agency missions and programs promoting interdisciplinary research and research groups facilitating technology transition and outreach to industry conducting studies on the societal implications of nanotechnology including those related to ethical educational legal and workforce issues and the development of metrics for measuring progress toward program goals

on august th an entity known as idefense sent out an announcement which is appended to this email briefly idefense which bills itself as a global security intelligence company is offering cash for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software that are not publicly known especially if you promise not to tell anyone else if this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue it will pose a very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure at the moment the dominant paradigm for computer security research known as full disclosure people who discover security vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them and a short while later after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem they publish the information including code to exploit the vulnerability if possible this method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by cert in the late s which its proponents might call responsible disclosure never release working exploit code and never release any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released a patch this procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked on features and often even after the patches were released people wouldnt apply them because they didnt know how serious the problem was the underground computer criminal community would often discover and exploit these same holes for months or years while the responsible disclosure process kept their victims who had no connections in the underground vulnerable the problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known are much less dangerous because their victims can take steps to reduce their potential impact including disabling software turning off vulnerable features filtering traffic in transit and detecting and responding to intrusions they are therefore much less useful to wouldbe intruders also software companies usually see security vulnerabilities in their software as pr problems and so prefer to delay publication and the expense of fixing the bugs as long as possible idefense is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous than either of the two previous paradigms they want to be a buyer in a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information rewarding discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash not long before snosoft a group of security researchers evidently including some criminal elements apparently made an offer to sell the secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software vendor specifically they apparently made a private offer to hewlettpackard to keep a vulnerability in hps tru unix secret if hp retained snosofts consulting services hp considered this extortion and responded with legal threats and snosoft published the information if this is allowed to happen it will cause two problems which together add up to a catastrophe first secret software vulnerability information will be available to the highest bidder and to nobody else for reasons explained later i think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime syndicates although that will not be obvious to the sellers second finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will become lucrative for many more talented people the result will be just as in the responsible disclosure days that the good guys will remain vulnerable for months and years while the majority of current vulnerabilities are kept secret ive heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the vendors of the vulnerable software but i dont think thats plausible if someone can steal because a software bug lets them the software vendor is never held liable often in fact the people who administer the software arent liable either when credit card data are stolen from an ecommerce site for example knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a website administrator some time and it might save the software vendor some negative pr but it can net the thief thousands of dollars i think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability information is most lucrative the thieves who can use it to execute the largest heists without getting caught inevitably that means organized crime syndicates although the particular gangs who are good at networked theft may not yet exist there might be the occasional case where a market leader such as microsoft could make more money by giving their competitors bad pr than a gang could make by theft think of a remoteroot hole in samba for example right now people who know how to find security exploits are either motivated by personal interest in the subject motivated by the public interest motivated by a desire for individual recognition or personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits creating a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly increase the availability of that information to the people who can afford to pay the most for it spies terrorists and organized crime lets not let that happen this is the original idefense announcement from sunil james mailtosjamesidefensecom sent wednesday august pm subject introducing idefenses vulnerability contributor program greetings idefense is pleased to announce the official launch of its vulnerability contributor program vcp the vcp pays contributors for the advance notification of vulnerabilities exploit code and malicious code idefense hopes you might consider contributing to the vcp the following provides answers to some basic questions about the program q how will it work a idefense understands the majority of security researchers do not publish security research for compensation rather it could be for any of a number of motivations including the following pure love of security research the desire to protect against harm to targeted networks the desire to urge vendors to fix their products the publicity that often accompanies disclosure the vcp is for those who want to have their research made public to the internet community but who would also like to be paid for doing the workthe compensation will depend among other things on the following items the kind of information being shared ie vulnerability or exploit the amount of detail and analysis provided the potential severity level for the information shared the types of applications operating systems and other software and hardware potentially affected verification by idefense labs the level of exclusivity if any for data granted to idefense q who should contribute to the vcp a the vcp is open to any individual security research group or other entity q why are you launching this program a timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence contributions to some lists take time before publication to the public at large more often many of these services charge clients for access without paying the original contributor under the idefense program the contributor is compensated idefense labs verifies the issue and idefense clients and the public at large are warned in a timely manner q who gets the credit a the contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or exploit information q when can i contribute the vcp is active you are welcome to begin contributing today to learn more go to if you have questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the vcp please contact us at contributoridefensecom regards sunil james technical analyst idefense idefense is a global security intelligence company that proactively monitors sources throughout the world from technical vulnerabilities and hacker profiling to the global spread of viruses and other malicious code the ialert security intelligence service provides decisionmakers frontline security professionals and network administrators with timely access to actionable intelligence and decision support on cyberrelated threats idefense labs is the research wing that verifies vulnerabilities examines the behavior of exploits and other malicious code and discovers new softwarehardware

date sun sep from brent welch welchpanasascom messageid baablackcombpanasascom i would encourage folks to play with those lines of code in text_selection and report what works well for them we may come up with lines that work for everyone or perhaps introduce yet another setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models of course thats an admission of policy failure but im willing to do that i actually think youre looking in the wrong place i at least have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted or selected that stuff for me if perhaps not users of some gnome variant which appraently has been fixed anyway all seems to work just fine the problem is that a button click clears the selection primary where it shouldnt the previous selection should only be cleared when theres something else to replace it even if the highlighting of what is selected is removed try this in any other ramdom application from xterm to netscape and see how it works there normally is no mouse based way to actually clear the primary selection that is set it to be a null string then because of the if i get asked for the selection value i will find something behaviour if you click intending to set the insert point the way most other guis operate and then paste because the primary is clear but exmh still owns the selection because nothing else has taken it it does and finds some other ramdom stuff from either the clipboard or cut buffer which tends to be something that was deleted back in the ancient past and pastes that that behaviour to me anyway is the real issue once that gets fixed we can switch back to operating the normal select stuff click at new insert point paste mode of operation that almost everyone expects to work whether the select stuff is somewhere in one of the exmh windows or elsewhere kre ps this message is from my experience as a exmh user only ive never really understood enough about x and selections to go gazing at that part of the code and see how it all really operates _______________________________________________ exmhusers mailing list exmhusersredhatcom

quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm id like to think about deployment eventually individuals and postmasters should be able to download a spambayes software distribution answer a few configuration questions about their mail setup training and false positives and install it as a filter a more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can easily be used by individuals since were more likely to find individuals willing to risk this than postmasters there are many ways to do this some ideas a program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server you configure it by telling it about your real pop servers you then point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost when it receives a connection it connects to the remote pop servers reads your mail and gives you only the nonspam to train it youd only need to send it the false negatives somehow it can assume that anything is ham that you dont say is spam within hours a server with a custom protocol that you send a copy of a message and that answers spam or ham then you have a little program that is invoked eg by procmail that talks to the server the server exists so that it doesnt have to load the pickle with the scoring database for each message i dont know how big that pickle would be maybe loading it each time is fine or maybe marshalling your idea here takers how is esrs bogofilter packaged spamassassin the perl bayes filter advertised on slashdot guido van rossum home page

press release from the ayn rand institute alton parkway suite irvine ca july for immediate release government regulation is killing the stock market irvine ca the steep decline in the stock market is being fueled by investors realization that increasing government constraints on corporate america will harm business and the economynot help them said yaron brook executive director of the ayn rand institute instead of launching a witchhunt against ceos and rushing to give the government wider powers over business we should get rid of the complex and contradictory regulations that encourage bad accounting and prevent shareholders from acting in their own interest the common explanation that greed is to blame makes no sensethe abuses in companies like enron and worldcom were not exercises in selfinterest but in selfdestruction in an unfettered free market the desire for profit is satisfied by honest longrange rational behavior by innovating by hiring the best employees by selling quality products and by providing accurate information to the owners of the corporationthe shareholders as for shortrange managers the markets will not tolerate them as for the real swindlers existing laws against force and fraud are sufficient to protect us if our politicians are indeed concerned about the stock market said dr brook let them demonstrate it by eliminating not adding regulations and making the market truly free ayn rand institute executive director dr yaron brook is available for interviews on this topic contact larry benson email larrybaynrandorg phone ext read dr brooks full oped at for more information on aris unique point of view go to medialink at the institutes web site at wwwaynrandorg founded in the ayn rand institute promotes the philosophy of ayn rand author of atlas shrugged and the fountainhead if you wish to have your email gazettevineyardnet removed from this list please send an email to davidhaynrandorg with the email address to be removed thank you

the wall street journal september commentary rebuild at ground zero by larry silverstein earlier this month we new yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the horrific events that befell our city on sept all of those who perished must never be forgotten the footprints of the fallen twin towers and a portion of the acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims families and indeed for all of us but for the good of the city and the region the millionplus square feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the twin towers must be replaced on the site about people worked in the world trade center those jobs are lost along with those of another people who worked in the vicinity together those jobs in lower manhattan for which the trade center was the economic stimulus produced annual gross wages of about billion or of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state some of the firms have relocated elsewhere in the city and region but many have not new york city is facing a budget deficit without additional jobs the deficit may become permanent this is one reason for the importance of rebuilding if we do not replace the lost space lower manhattan never will regain the vibrancy it had as the worlds financial center love them or hate them and there were lots of new yorkers on both sides of the issue the towers made a powerful statement to the world that said this is new york a symbol of our free economy and of our way of life that is why they were destroyed this is a second reason why the towers must be replaced and with buildings that make a potent architectural statement in recent weeks redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many sources most of these focus not on the trade center site however but on all of lower manhattan further many believe that the million square feet either could be located elsewhere scattered in several sites or simply never rebuilt these proposals miss the point what was destroyed and what must be recovered was the trade center not all of lower manhattan except over the towers footprints where there must be no commercial development the office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size that was a major reason why the twin towers were leased to occupancy before none of the other sites proposed for office development has remotely equal transportation access with the reconstruction of the subway and path stations plus an additional billion in transit improvements planned such as the new fulton transit center and the direct traintotheplane long island rail road connection the site becomes even more the logical locus of office development and new york will need the space before the group of a task force of civic leaders led by sen charles schumer and former treasury secretary robert rubin concluded that the city would need an additional million square feet of new office space by to accommodate the anticipated addition of new jobs the loss of the twin towers only heightens the need as for those who say that million square feet of office space downtown can not be absorbed by the real estate market i would simply point out that history shows them wrong new york now has about million square feet of office space all new construction underway already is substantially leased up new york had million square feet of vacant office space at the beginning of the recession in by this space had been absorbed at an annual rate of about million square feet we are seeking to rebuild million square feet on the trade center site over a period of about years with the first buildings not coming on line until and the project reaching completion in this is an annual absorption rate of about a million feet much lower than the s rate those who argue that new york can not reabsorb office space that it previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an extended period of stagnation and decline i will not accept this view nor will most new yorkers mayor michael bloomberg said in a recent interview with the new york times that the city has to do two things memorialize but also build for the future i believe that the twin towers site can gracefully accommodate and that downtown requires office and retail space of architectural significance a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what happened and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as residents of the area the challenge to accomplish this is enormous but our city is up to the task mr silverstein is president of silverstein properties a real estate firm whose affiliates hold year leases on the world trade center site r a hettinga mailto rahibuccom the internet bearer underwriting corporation farquhar street boston ma usa however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity predicting the end of the world has not been found agreeable to experience edward gibbon decline and fall

i suspect that as part of chris set of changes he cleaned up the use of the variable that was named l in ftoccommit in ftoctcl its name got changed from l to lineno but theres one reference of l left that causes tracebacks if you attempt to use link with the current cvs version of exmh i guess that most of us dont use link very often i noticed it last week but only got time to look and see why today if someone with the ability to commit to the cvs repository would apply the following patch to libftoctcl that would be nice it works and is trivial and you could perhaps just apply it by making the change with an editor faster than saving this patch and applying it theres only one instance of l in the file that should be changed to lineno kre

original message from damien morton mailtodamienmortonacmorg sent saturday august to polrevhooverstanfordedu subject re al qaedas fantasy ideology youre right of course the attack was performed for its effect on muslims not for its effect on the us by showing that it can be done they inspire others to follow in their path or so they hope i take some objection to the belabouring of the term fantasy because it is somewhat perjorative imagining different worlds can often lead the world to become more like that imagined moreso if action is taken on the basis of those imaginings theres an interesting parralel with the great capitalist dream that anyone can make anything happen through hard work and a bit of luck this is equally a fantasy but one made to approach reality through consensus an interesting question then becomes if al quedas actions are in furtherance of a fantasy what fantasies are george bushs actions in furtherace of how many of the actions of george bush and the us are performed for their effect on the us population for example how much showmanship has been put into rebuilding the morale of wall street is this not as much a spirtual investment as the sacrifices al queda made what cultural myopia is in play here in the us i make a point of reading australian britsish and us news today i noticed that the australian and british news are featuring the iraqi overtures to the un on inspectors while us news is featuring iraqi war preparations digging bunkers etc at a time that the us is withdrawing from international cooperation on multiple levels the fantasy of being surrounded by enemies invisible preferably is somewhat appealing a self fullfilling prophesy if you like perhaps thats whats at work here

it was the spring of i was just a tall goofy looking kid in middle school with buckteeth and freckles each day in the cafeteria i walked from table to table stealing other kids lunch money no i didnt rob them with a gun or a knife i just made them a little deal let me borrow two dollars today i said and ill bring you five dollars next week the investment was too good to pass up and other kids were throwing their lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes of course when next week rolled around and i couldnt pony up the cash i promised to pay them even more the week after that if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit longer eventually the end of the year came and went high school started and with it came girls and homework and parties and sports and those poor kids from eighth grade had more things on their mind than last years lunch money i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid and i didnt even get beat up hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market secrets you will ever learn first of all greed is your number one enemy youre not going to turn into in a week so cash out when youre ahead dont wait for the boat to sink before grabbing the lifejacket second never trust an investment adviser of any kind they are looking out for their own money not yours the professionals those stuffy investment counselors and money managers will always tell you that the best time to buy is now according to those guys the longer you keep your money in the market the more money youre going to make ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is never in a sense they are right if you put in an index fund right now youll probably have over a million dollars in thirty or forty years but heres the problem do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich hell no you want the money now so you can enjoy it its hard to make use of your fortune when youre seventy years old in a wheelchair if you could make a million dollars in the next few years what would you do with it where would you travel what kind of car would you buy the fact is youth is the best time to be rich if your goal is to make quick profits in the

paul jakmas paulclubiie lines of wisdom included i thought the firewalling code on all the bsds was fairly related sorry so freebsds ipfw is not encumbered in the same way the old obsd firewalling was nope indeed ipfw has just been rolled out into stable stable is a stable branch of the code that has been rolled into current first its basically a major release thats still a work in progress to an extent i guess so yes but ive a few boxes with reasonable uptimes that run netfilteriptables ive one that has crashed twice now after day uptimes but that doesnt seem to be netfilter course theres a lot more that can go wrong with a firewall than the firewall code in that case get boxes and heartbeat them i dont really judge things by uptimes its rather like judging penis size people like comparing them and the larger they are the more people are in awe of them but overly large ones arent really practical indeed couldnt agree more thats the nice thing about nix fact we can have nitpicking arguments about which nix and firewall code is better defiantely i wouldnt like anyone to accuse me of being a nitpicker though ive no experience of ipfw closest ive come is looking at ipfilter for irix but it had a problem in that it wasnt maintained anymore however while the englishy syntax is nice i dont think iptables command args syntax is a big obstacle anyway theres choice and as i understand it with the advent of netfilteriptables theres now almost nothing between them from a technical pov apart from ipfw being in use a lot longer well as someone whos used ipchains quite heavily about two years ago i can guarantee you that the learning curve for reading ipchains rules and ipfw rules is quite different of course once youve memorised not necessarily sitting down with a sheet of them and learning them off by rote them you wonder what all the fuss is about before its not in itself a reason to choose one firewall product over another but if thats all there is in the difference and the learning curve for the operating system is the same then i know what id prefer as a beginner this is all getting rather offtopic now anyways but since ive been doing quite a lot of work with ipfw over the last week i jumped on the bandwagon philip reynolds rfc networks tel wwwrfcnetworksie fax irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

hello gary uh plague is not action no no one has a problem quarantining someone who has say ebola or malaria because diseases do not require any decisive action just contact fantasies still require decisive action even if its in conjunction with the way the fantasy works in the individuals brain many people have very strange and obscure fantasies say wanting to be a model that dont require them to be locked up fantasies arent nearly as much like plagues not everyone in a given population necessarily adheres to that given fantasy whereas everyone can get a given plague btw gary the whole concept of monitoring a given racial populaiton for fear of them getting a plague is silly i dont think plagues discriminate youre trying to argue for a lockem all up mentality when i dont think anyone but you has even mentioned it his point was that fantaesies were a psychological explanation for a possible event not that all people who have them or even have a certain type need to be locked up quarantined killed rubbedout or cleansed glm well for example b bitbitch bitbitchmagnesiumnet writes glm b once we understand this the fantasy virus model many of glm b our current perplexities will find themselves glm b resolved pseudoissues such as debates over the legitimacy of glm b racial profiling would disappear does anyone in his right glm b mind object to screening someone entering his country for signs glm b of plague or quarantining those who have contracted it or glm b closely monitoring precisely those populations within his glm b country that are most at risk best regards bitbitch mailtobitbitchmagnesiumnet

airline filed for bankruptcy protection the arlington vabased carrier sought cover under the bankruptcy codes chapter but much of its trouble could be traced to sept remember when all us airports reopened except for reagan washington which was too close to the white house and other gov sites remember how it was weeks before the first lonely flights lifted at last guess which airline was the major carrier there hint its the same one that bled billion in the past year even before the terror attacks us airways was an animal in pain to all the usual industry troubles add these fierce competition from discounters a toosmall area of service concentrated on the east coast and an unofficial battle with united airlines for the highest labor costs in the business frustrated the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years ago reminded the washington post in a bid to get bought by united us airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators that it was too small to survive on its own the feds disagreed and blocked the deal now of course us airways has a new flight plan among those likely to get airsick shareholders whose investment has vanished employees many of whom are expected to lose their jobs even though their unions have conceded hundreds of millions of dollars in pay and creditors especially planeleasing companies which will collect only as much as a bankruptcy judge

corporate scandals remembering back to global crossings january implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to recall the fuss over chads the financial times pegged the companys bankruptcy sale friday a longawaited transaction but few other outlets seemed to be holding their breath the dearth of coverage is too bad because the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention especially with enron and worldcom following behind it in the chapter aisle bankruptcy it seems means never having to say youre sorry global crossing owed billion when it filed for bankruptcy in january its sale price million and thats for only a nearly twothirds stake sound too low back in january global crossing could have gotten much more three times that much and from the very same investment team asian conglomerates hutchison whampoa and singapore technologies telemedia but global crossing sniffed it was worth way more now that it has discovered its worth way less heres how the deal carves up whats left of global crossings pie pending the regulatory approval thats expected in about six months the two investors get a stake bank creditors get and bondholders get about a onethird share whos missing from the sliceanddice shareholders of course who get nothing the company is unapologetic and creditors feel lucky for the crumbs the reality is we could have done considerably worse the wall street

david neary said for the francophones among you this article is a summary of the reasons why most free software licences and the gpl in particular are not valid in france google translation hard to read most of the time but good enough to pick up the gist in brief in an international contract when mentioning copyright you must mention under which jurisdictions laws the copyright is applied french law requires the licence to be available in french the gpl isnt and french law requires that for a contract to be valid it must not breach existing law also under french law the copyright holder automatically retains the right to change the licence which means that french law is in conflict with the gpl which requires authorisation from all authors before a licence change is allowed also theres some stuff about french consumer law forbidding sale without guarantee of anything so software delivered asis breaches consumer law in france but i didnt really follow that my french is a bit iffy these days but if this is true does it not also nullify microsoft adobe and winzip licences amongst most others these all claim no liability no guarantees m say delivered with all faults so at least they are honest ciaran irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

all our mailings are sent complying to the proposed hr unsolicited commercial electronic mail act of please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions parents of year old find cash hidden in his closet does this headline look familiar of course it does you most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program usa and reported elsewhere in the world including my neck of the woods new zealand his mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her yearold sons closet nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash fivedollar bills twenties fifties and hundreds all neatly rubberbanded in labelled piles my first thought was that he had robbed a bank says the yearold woman there was over dollars in that bag thats more than my husband earns in a year the woman immediately called her husband at the cardealership where he worked to tell him what she had discoveredhe came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet as it turns out the boy had been sending out via email a type of report to email addresses that he obtained off the internet everyday after school for the past months he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom i just got the email one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out says the clever yearold the email letter listed addresses and contained instructions to send one dollar bill to each person on the list then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses down and finally to add your name to the top of the list the letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in fivedollar bills within weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the address list i get junk email all the time and really did not think it was going to work the boy continues within the first few days of sending out the email the post office box that his parents had gotten him for his videogame magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines but envelopes containing bills about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had magazine and about envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter i thought i was in trouble or something laughs he goes on i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all over the next few weeks the boy continued sending out the email the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homeworkhe had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the bills for twenties fifties and hundreds i didnt want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for meone time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs surprisingly the boy did not have any reason to be afraidthe reporting news team examined and investigated the socalled chainletter the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chainletter at allin fact it was completely legal according to us postal and lottery laws title section and or title section in the us code also in the code of federal regulations volume sections and which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received every fivedollar bill that he received contained a little note that read please send me report number xyxthis simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service a report on howto for a fivedollar fee this is the end of the media release if you would like to understand how the system works

was just no way that i wouldnt get enough orders to at least get my money back i was surprised when i found my medium size post office box crammed with orders i made in the first weeks the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live there simply isnt a better investment with a faster return and so big dan sondstrom alberta canada i had received this program before i

nor what color your passport more american exceptionalism the united states is the only country in the world to tax its citizens on a worldwide basis irrespective of whether they spend time in the country or whether they have assets there said philip marcovici a zurichbased lawyer with international law firm baker and mackenzie and perhaps even irrespective of their current citizenship under current expatriation law there are wealth thresholds based on net worth which lead to a presumption that a person giving up us citizenship is doing so for tax reasons individuals who have given up their citizenship and who have earned in any one of the years before expatriation or who have a net worth exceeding would automatically be deemed a socalled taxpatriate those persons would be subject to ordinary income tax on us source income for years they would also be subject to us estate and gift tax during the year period i suppose it could be much worse there could be some twee affinity program for us citizenship and a bank of phone people who only get paid well if they manage to keep one from cancelling membership dave last month congress proposed a new exit tax on all citizens who give up their us status if the proposal becomes law individuals will be taxed as if they had either sold everything or died this would give rise to immediate exposure to capital gains tax to be fair would this mean that theyd also immediately pay out the difference for anyone whose tax basis was greater than current estate value australian cities overall scored particularly highly in the economist intelligence unit survey of desirability for expats with all five the countrys urban centres surveyed ranked near the top of the table europe was also well represented among the top places the top us city honolulu ranked st with boston at th the highest ranked city on the us mainland canada in contrast sneaked three cities into the top ten the uk cities of london th and manchester th gained only a midtable rating with port moresby in papua new guinea bottom of the list

regarding another problem i have is that i can not install my isdn usb modem lasat speed basic however im pretty sure its not supported by linux but again it is featured in the hardware browser without installed drivers thanks for your replies however i still cant get it to detect the external usb modem i also have an internal k fax modem but i can not get that detected either maybe its because it was designed for windows and is not supported im not going to buy a new modem i think is more than enough for pc it could well be my inexperience with linux that is making this more difficult but whatever it is iv just about had enough any last gasp ideas would be welcome many thanks mark irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

hi i was inspired by a mode of operation supported by vmware you can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine vm instances that base image is never altered by a vm instance instead each vm instance writes changes to its own redo log future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine this is described here thanks to duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list could this basic concept be used to easily make selffixing clientserver applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks even before those attacks have been discovered here is what i imagine the physical architectures of most production clientserver systems are layered for example your basic web application might have a web server running apache connected to an application server running some jee or net business logic connected to a database server for persistence the only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server and even here you often put the static rdbms software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition it is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next other paritions may need to be writable for say swap space but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot when someone cracks this system they will probably change an image that shouldnt be changed eg they might leverage a buffer overflow in iis or apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server but what if the web server ran off a base image writing changes to a delta or redo partition and then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted the downtime involved for each machine would be minimal because it is only deleting data rather than restoring from backup in a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible this baseredo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware raid allowing for greater performance reliability and hack resistance this concept could also be applied to the application servers and even the database server partitions except for those partitions which contain the table data files of course does anyone do this already or is this a new concept or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that i dont yet know i use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems it would allow for the hardwareseparation of volatile and nonvolatile disk images it would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations only it would be more efficient and involve less or no downtime thanks for any opinions ben

i use a mostly red hat system but prefer to configure and build my kernel by hand id like to humbly offer a tweak to alsadriverspec that helps it build cleanly under such circumstances i recognize that freshrpmsnet packages are designed with standard red hat in mind including a standard kernel rpm however i hope that matthias will consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation the diff is attached below the first part of the diff contains a conditional that checks to see if the expected rpm is installed if it is karch is set as before and a new krpm flag is set to if the expected rpm is not installed then karch is instead set using uname p while krpm is left undefined the second part of the diff is simpler we only require that kernelsource be installed if the kernel itself came from an rpm if the kernel was handbuilt the presumably the user knows enough to have retained the sources in the expected place again i realize that im operating off warrantee by not using a red hat kernel rpm matthias if you think this tweak is reasonable and not too ugly id love to see you pick it up if not well at least this message will sit in the archives and may help other folks in the future

i also have received both the virus and email on how to get rid of it luckily i dont open any attachments unless im expecting them and then am still very careful heres the ways i was told to get rid of the thing one fix tool download fix_sircamcom and run the file it will scan drive c and subfolders and runs in dos another trojan fix tool the fix tool will run from your desktop and will automatically rid your computer from the sircam trojan and clean up an entries from your registry files after running either fix tool reboot your system hope this helps richard homeaffiliatemailcom

nicetyaolcom subject what can i do about my computer freezing issue my computer freezes when i use aol and sometimes when im just using the basic functions of windows my defragmentor keeps starting over and over and my scan disk never finds anything wrong but there has to be dear nicety as regards your problem with windoze freezing and locking up your computer im afraid your sol as finding a true solution there are many factors in the operating system that cause conflicts resulting in a locked machine one major problem is that many programs dont release memory when you exit when working in windoze ive always taken the approach of rebooting on a regular basis before ive had problems especially if ive opened and closed several different applications back in august john kirch a microsoft certified professional wrote an extensive article discussing the merits of a nix operating system vs windows nt you can read it at what was true back then is even truer today every current worm you are hearing about on the news lately occurs in windoze operating systems so imho the solution to your machine lockingup is to change the os running linux my machine has been up for periods of weeks at a time with no need to reboot in over a year of running i can count the lockups on one hand and have fingers left over i have more software installed than i ever had in windoze and the price

garrison webmastersharesmilescom site gofreetyahoocomau site infotpcenterprisescom site reviewed comments on site margarete mdegastonaolcom i really love clean uncluttered easy to read and navigate sites like these two they are both very attractive and well presented in my opinion the book site could have been a little softer or with similar characteristics to the next site preparing me for the site that it links to and having a relationship to it what i did feel most was that i was expecting something related to the url prosperouswomen to come up as this word was what caught my attention and caused me to click in the first place i feel the book page should be a tool for the pw page and not a preface to it the main site should be the pw and the book site could be a link or a popup or an additional page you need to take e out of changing on the book page with these find out how you can receive the free book email us at directionsuaolcom and for this and a number of other free books on networkmarketing write to us at directionsuaolcom i would have liked these to be clickable links rather than copy and paste very nice job on the sites margarete i really liked them and i have ordered the book i waited over seconds and had yet to see the first page could not determine if this was related to volume of graphics or where we were headed very clear focused site with one page promoting a free book dont underline text unless its a link or somehow distinguish between the links and that which is not i finally figured out the logo for properouswomen was also linked so i checked that out also i think you need to make that link more noticeable and also link to your bizland site if you used a form for ordering the book instead of sending a request message to an aol email address you would get more requests and also might be able to automate this process i loved this site because it was clear simple and to the point it also peaked my curiosity and i followed the link supplied if only other sites we so simplistic with the masterminding site the first sentence major impact on your life is incomplete there were also runon sentences in the copy even though the copy is quite effective the box with life changeing insight needs the e taken out of changeing and it looked like the text could have been extended to go from side to side in the first paragraph an amazing year old text felt like it should be book or secret instead of using the word text also it would add credibility to say where or how or by whom it was discovered the message is clear the site design simple two things that would make the site more effective on getting people to request the book would be to say if this is an ebook how long it is in what format it is etc and then also using a form for people to order instead of emailing you should be able to pick up a form for this just about anywhere ______________________________________________________ moderator amy mossel

on aug the voices made scott a crosby write on sun aug cest tony l svanstrom tonysvanstromcom writes on sun aug the voices made tony l svanstrom write the solution is of course to have a public key of some sort associated with the domainame itself at the registrarlevel so that when an email arrives the server can check if the sendingserver actually is responsible for the domainuser the email appears to have been sent from that can be problematic for example if im at home and want to send email out from my workaddress i cant go through my isps mailserver i dont thikn we want to enforce a link linking an email address and the server sending it there are many reasons to have the two things be different entities true but thats the thinking of today that the company mailserver can be closed to you from the outside because as it is today you can use any mail server that youve got access to if theres a good reason for setting it up they wont be that lazy in the future however requiring mailservers to sign the received header that could be useful assuming the signature is of reasonable size that could indicate at what server the email did enter the system itd also be incontravertable proof that that mailserver did allow itself to be abused signatures could be checked by either mx or inaddrarpa records indicating the hosts public key theres still some problems left though youd have to bind the headers to the message somehow via signatures to avoid someone taking an email then twiddling the body and claiming that spam came from a particular host this would mean that you couldnt alter the body of a message an unforgable received chain would be very useful evidence a simple rfc could fix that today either using a new header or extending the receivedheader with a codevalue that the server later on can verify maybe something like this received date date local subdomtld ip remote subdomtld ip envid theusualstuffsubdomtld code cache salted hashvalue rsa or other signature and then you have the two optional from and to only added by the sending server thats identified the local sender or the server accepting mail for a certain user to verify that it did really come via that server in case you forward it using procmail or something like it you of course would need some standard for how to check these headers not perfect but better than what we have today tony per scientiam ad libertatem through knowledge towards freedom genom kunskap mot frihet c tonysvanstromcom perl eprint__ for sort_lynx source svanstromcomt this sfnet email is sponsored bythinkgeek welcome to geek heaven _______________________________________________ spamassassintalk mailing list spamassassintalklistssourceforgenet

i agree with rob i think if the phones and mms is building traction in europe in handsets this might be interesting bottom line is will it a help sell phones and b bill enough time on the wcarriers networks anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad low quality small in size but kids totally dug that stuff seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs i dont think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography developed at the local hour joint or digital photos on your pc i think it expands the market and forms a new category the extent of the category size is the big question will it be a fad or will it a sustained market thats consumer behavior and marketing but i dont think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market in this case digital photos or normal photos europes the one to watch more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right theyll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them h from rob shavell robmobiusvccom to mike masnick miketechdirtcom cc forkspamassassintaintorg subject re sprint delivers the next big thing date wed aug right mike i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart my opinion is only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications instant show that we cross easily though you are right as rain on pricing i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion eyes which can instantly share what they see amongst each other that doesnt mean that people will stop talking on their phones or that people will spend more time wimages than voice just that it is fundamental from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of photography by orders of magnitude and in short order and yes changes things big time rgds rob original message from mike masnick mailtomiketechdirtcom sent tuesday august pm to rob shavell cc forkspamassassintaintorg subject re sprint delivers the next big thing not to keep harping on this but at pm rob shavell wrote content who cares about content that no one can think of useful content is always the business persons mistake the content is the users communications its anything and everything avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day mainly humorous id guess who cares if content is trivial in nature picture speaks a thousand words this does nothing to answer my question i do care about content hell if i could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day id have a different opinion of this i just am not convinced that they will stupid or not while a picture may be worth a thousand words and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made how many people do you know who communicate by pictures sure it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something i dont buy it for most messages text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism for some messages pictures do the job but i would say not nearly as often as words why do you think pictionary and charades and such are games because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across misc ramblings i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about hour photo processing trivial who needs it i get better resultion elswhere and yet it had great decentralizing impact the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation the digital camera and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion which will put the photo giants to bed and change the world in a meaningful way also sms didnt take off because its easy it took off because it costs less its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the profitabilty of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth in reality sms cannibilizes the voice revs they bought their networks to handle again this is the same argument my colleague made along with you just dont understand kids today and theyll run with this i wasnt saying that mms wouldnt take off because it wasnt high quality or that it wasnt easy i was saying that i couldnt see why people would use it in a way that changed the face of communications im looking for the compelling reason even if its a stupid one why people would want to do this sure if they integrate cameras into the phone and the quality improves even only marginally i can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people but mostly i dont see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someones email address or putting together an online or offline photoalbum i dont think hour photos are trivial people want to see their own pics right away and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots thats one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on the instant view part im guessing your argument is that people not only want instant view but also instant show which is what this service offers im not convinced that most people want instant show i think people like to package their pictures and show them thats why people put together fancy albums and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture sure occasionally instant show is nice but its just nice on occasion i still cant see how it becomes a integral messaging method whats the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another there has to be some benefit even if its silly if people are going to flock to it im searching no one has given me a straight answer yet the only really intriguing idea ive heard about things like mms lately are dan gillmors assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones from all different angles and those photos tell the real story of what happened before the press even gets there willing to be proven wrong mike ps if the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are then mms is never going to catch on

i have a situation with a small network as follows a number of client workstations which are running vmware each of which will run a local copy of samba not the vmware autoinstalled version to let vmware access local linux disks an nisnfs server which will also run samba to allow the vmware clients access to its filesystems how can i set things up so that all the vmware clients all running doze possibly being upgraded in future to wk authenticate against the nis servers samba i have read the samab documentation in large quantities down through the years but as ive never wanted to do anything like this i never paid much attention to all the stuff about domain controllers etc which i presume is what i will need to have running here i would also like if at all possible to have synchronisation of passwords between the nis domain and the nis servers samba with minimal manual intervention ideas accompanied by annotated samba configration files gratefully received niall irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

tim peters wrote ive run no experiments on training set size yet and wont hazard a guess as to how much is enough im nearly certain that the hs ive been using is way more than enough though okay i believe you each call to learn and to unlearn computes a new probability for every word in the database theres an official way to avoid that in the first two loops eg for msg in spam gblearnmsg true false gbupdate_probabilities i did that its still really slow when you have thousands of messages in each of the last two loops the total of ham and total of spam in the learned set is invariant across loop trips and you could break into the abstraction to exploit that the only probabilities that actually change across those loop trips are those associated with the words in msg then the runtime for each trip would be proportional to the of words in the msg rather than the number of words in the database i hadnt tried that i figured it was better to find out if all but one testing had any appreciable value it looks like it doesnt so ill forget about it another area for potentially fruitful study its clear that the highestvalue indicators usually appear early in msgs and for spam theres an actual reason for that advertising has to strive to get your attention early so for example if we only bothered to tokenize the first of a msg would results get worse spammers could exploit this including a large mime part at the beginning of the message in pratice that would probably work fine sometimes an ontopic message starts well but then rambles never i remember the time when i was ten years old and went down to the fishing hole with my buddies this guy named gordon had a really huge head wait maybe that was joe well no matter as i recall it was a hot day and everyone was tiredhuman growth hormonegirl with huge breastsblah blah blah

hi folks apologies if this is the wrong place to ask but i am trying to do on my linux desktop what i used to do with some other os software im trying to use a combination of some bash scripts and some perl to generate reports from a couple of ascii files eventually these will run on a server and get the files by ftp analyse them and mail me the results as im no programmer by any stretch of the imagination im getting a bit lost i can deal with single files eventually using grep egrep awk and a nice perl script called total which i found while googling problem now is that the data im trying to report on is split between two isam files file contains docket number line number item quantity price duedate file contains docket number customer shipping date invoice number to make some sense of the data i need to relate the docket number between the files so that i can generate a report by customer my first reaction is to look at mysql and import the ascii data into tables so that i can use sql queries is this the way to go or should i delve a bit deeper into perl any advice welcome thanks declan irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

glad they finally figured this one out note the very careful wording so exhaust may be beneficial to ones health as long as you have a glass a day with some cheese interesting timing since truckers just lost their jobs and dont have to worry about death from this anymore adam l duncan beberg bebergmithralcom epa diesel exhaust can cause cancer wed sep am et by h josef hebert associated press writer washington ap inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other sources over time can cause cancer in humans an environmental protection agency news web sites report concludes after a decade of study the epa finding released tuesday is expected to buttress the governments push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleanerburning engines and diesel fuel with ultralow sulfur content while acknowledging uncertainties about the longterm health effects of exposure to diesel exhausts the epa report said studies involving both animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer risk to humans it is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental exposure levels as well the report said the potential human health effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive even though assumptions and uncertainties are involved the report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various world health agencies and studies in california and is particularly significant because the epa is the federal agency that regulates diesel emissions under the clean air act some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the bush administration might try to back away from a clintonera regulation that would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel epa administrator christie whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with the tougher truck and diesel rules last month with white house approval the epa rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone the requirements approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to meet an october deadline for making cleanerburning truck engines the engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel is expected to produce pollution reductions the epas page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the probability of an individual getting cancer given certain exposure to diesel exhaust such a risk assessment is commonly made by the epa when gauging pollution health concerns but in this case the report said the exposureresponse data are considered too uncertain to produce a confident quantitative estimate of cancer risk to an individual nevertheless said the report the totality of evidence from human animal and other supporting studies suggests that diesel exhaust is likely to be carcinogenic to humans by inhalation and that this hazard applies to environmental exposure the report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses shortterm health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a chronic respiratory hazard to humans contributing to increased asthma and other respiratory problems in some urban areas diesel exhausts account for as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot the report said environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from offroad dieselpowered vehicles epa spokeswoman steffanie bell said the agency expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust sources which include farm tractors and construction equipment emily figdor of the us public interest research group a private environmental organization said to reduce the publics exposure to harmful diesel emissions the bush administration should fully implement clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent standards for diesel construction and farm equipment allen schaeffer executive director of the industry group diesel technology forum said the epas report focused on the past whereas the future is clean diesel diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times cleaner than just a dozen years ago the report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in the mids but said the results continued to be valid because the slow turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road

begin forwarded text to rahphilodoxcom subject internet defamation suit ends with defense verdict date mon aug edt from somebody internet defamation suit ends with defense verdict john council texas lawyer in one of the first trials in the country to address internet defamation a dallas county texas jury last week rejected a million suit by an internet company that claimed it was harmed by negative electronic messages posted by an employee of a competing company zixit a dallas internet company filed zixit corp v visa international et al in alleging it was harmed by paul guthrie then a vice president with visa zixit alleged in its suit that guthrie posted more than anonymous messages many of them negative about zixit on the yahoo finance zixit internet message board causing zixits stock price to drop the suit also alleged that the postings destroyed the companys ability to market its zixcharge internet transaction authorization system which allows consumers to make purchases without revealing their credit card numbers to merchants visa has a similar internet payment system zixit alleged that the postings caused its stock price to plummet had the product been successful the company believed it would have been worth more than billion according to lawyers involved in the case on july a jury in judge merrill hartmans nd district court found that zixits product was not harmed by the postings neal manne and kenneth mcneil lawyers from houstons susman godfrey who represented zixit at trial did not return calls for comment by press time the company hasnt made any decision about an appeal says cindy lawrence a zixit spokeswoman the outcome of the lawsuit doesnt have any effect on our future products and services in emessaging getting graded visas lawyers alleged that guthrie acted on his own and had a right to free speech and that guthries internet postings had no effect on zixits stock guthrie has since left visa lawyers for the company say guthrie was not a defendant in the case however his interests in the case were represented by todd noonan an attorney in sacramento califs stevens oconnell noonan was recovering from surgery last week and was unavailable for comment i think people believe whether you succeed or fail is because of what you do and not what other people do to you internet companies didnt succeed for all sorts of reasons says jeff tillotson a partner in dallas lynn tillotson pinker who defended visa at trial zixits case was a hard sell to the jury especially with the reality of the economy tillotson says everyone knows that the stock market has fallen and the trouble with internet companies i think the jury took that into account tillotson says there were lessons to be learned from the internet defamation trial says mike lynn who also represented visa at trial even though message boards are considered a protected form of free speech that freedom wont prevent a company from being dragged into court if its employee blasts another company on the internet lynn says a company can be responsible for what an employee posts on a message board lynn says the courts have said youre entitled to go to a jury to determine whether there are damages as a result of that the law is very odd not mature and damage theories are not mature the nature of the case also added an interesting twist to the trial tillotson says many of those who posted messages on the board attended the trial and posted comments about the daily proceedings throughout the threeweek trial he says it was apparent to everyone that many of the people who posted on these message boards were watching the trial tillotson says it really was wild the lawyers felt like they were being graded end forwarded text r a hettinga mailto rahibuccom the internet bearer underwriting corporation farquhar street boston ma usa however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity predicting the end of the world has not been found agreeable to experience edward gibbon decline and fall of the roman empire

i apologize for not catching up to the current code in so long now that i have im trying to resolve breakage and differences the unseen window seems to have been replaced with the sequences window while i appreciate the flexibility of the sequences window the unseen window filled an importanttome need it was tiny and could be set to show on all desktops of a virtual window manager without taking a lot of space since my normal mode of operation involves two copies of exmh displaying on a x vnc session screen space is at a premium as things stand now i have a sequences window that shows a lot more information than i need to have handy and takes up a lot more room than i can spare i can see that i could like the new sequences window a lot for certain operations but id like a nice uncluttered tiny window that _only_ shows me info on my unread mail one possibility that occurs to me would be a button or mouse click that shrinks the sequences window to show only the sequences in the always show list and of course a way to expand it back hal _______________________________________________ exmhworkers mailing list exmhworkersredhatcom

on mon at jim whitehead wrote you have not explained why the increase in co concentrations is not contributing to increasing global temperature there are a number of reasons to think that co is not important to controlling global temperature and that much of the co increase may not be anthropogenic some recent research points worth mentioning recent highresolution studies of historical co concentrations and temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest correlation between the two in a number of cases co level increases are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the increase in temperature by a short time ie increases in temperature preceded increases in co concentrations the more studies that are done of the geological record the more it seems that co concentrations are correlated with temperature increases but are not significantly causative there is a lot of evidence that co levels are regulated in a fairly stable fashion i dont believe anyone really has an authoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet with respect to absolute co concentrations it is also important to point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly regular cycle with a period of about years at previous cycle peaks the concentrations were similar to what they are now if this cycle has any validity and we only have good data for complete cyclical periods but which look surprisingly regular in shape and time then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now as it happens current co concentrations are within of other previous cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data in other words we may be adding to the co levels but it looks a lot like we would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical record at the very least there is nothing anomalous about current co concentrations also co levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately affects temperature again the interaction is not entirely predictable but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative feedback systems mentioned above last as greenhouse gases go co isnt particularly potent although it makes up for it in volume in some cases gases such as water and methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule basis water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas something that co only indirectly effects through its interaction with the biosphere co was an easy mark for early environmentalism but all the recent studies and data ive seen gives me the impression that it is largely a passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver i certainly dont think it is a healthy fixation if were actually interested in understanding warming trends cheers james rogers jamesrbestcom

oh yeh one more thing none of this would explain why the signatures for samplespamtxt from spamassassin is registered on honor but not apt or fire original message from rose bobby sent thursday august am to mailvipulnet razorusersexamplesourceforgenet subject re razorusers whats wrong with the razor servers now thanks that helps theres still so little info on tes and those of us here since razorv know how it works i did set my min_cf to ac which i thought would be zero so the way you are suggesting that it works now is that everyone has a trust level of and have to work their way up your trust level increases when someone nominates the same message as spam this must have been the new changes made at the beginning of the week unless the changes dumped everyones trust level now here come the questions what engine signature does tes look at does it have to be the same e signature or does it use the e or e signatures how many people have to nominate the message before everyones rating increases how many revokes decreases someones rating does a single revoke decrease the rating of everyone that nominated the message if a newby reports a message that has already been reported does their trust level immediately go up in the case of revoking does someone with a trust level of have the capability to revoke a message submitted by multiple people with higher trust levels original message from vipul ved prakash mailtomailvipulnet sent thursday august am to razorusersexamplesourceforgenet subject re razorusers whats wrong with the razor servers now bobby couple of things if you are not a trusted reporter your reports will not have an immediate effect it takes a bunch of trusted reporters to bump up the confidence of a signature to a point where it is considered to be spam this might be frustrating initially but as the number of trusted users grows the time delay between nominations and determination will become shorter of course its a lot more frustating for people to have their legit mail filtered out due to incorrect reporting also for the purpose of testing id suggest making your min_cf in razoragentsconf to min_cf defaults to the server recommended average confidence which at the moment is setting min_cf to should return true for whatever you submit as long as it was not revoked by a trusted user aptfire sync with honor every minutes so youd have to wait for a _maximum_ of minutes before signatures propagate cheers vipul on wed aug at pm rose bobby wrote this is still happening nothing that i report is being registered at all i have confirmed that this also affects the cloudmark outlook plugin if i block a message from outlook using spamnet then run it against the folder containing the message that was reported then nothing happens on the unix side ive tried different cloudmark servers different identies report from different systems etc without an effect i did find that samplespamtxt from spamassassin is only registered on honorcloudmarknet and comes back positive from it and it only so its clearly not syncd with apt or fire original message from rose bobby sent wednesday august pm to patrick cc mlrazorusers subject re razorusers whats wrong with the razor servers now im sure others have thought of that probably the only way to prevent that is to include the host in the reportrevoke authentication original message from patrick mailtopatrickstealthgeeksnet sent wednesday august pm to rose bobby cc mlrazorusers subject re razorusers whats wrong with the razor servers now on wed aug rose bobby wrote well at least its been confirmed i can say for cetain that it started on monday since that was when i noticed a huge drop in stats of messages that were tagged as being in razor and i know it was fine on friday it may have something to do with the upgrades on the servers that vipul mentioned if tes is going to decide on what gets registered and what doesnt then razorreport should provide some debug info about the refusal you are correct about the need for more info on tes but it probably wont happen for fear of circumvention insert rant regarding security through obscurity on the way into work i thought of some fairly easy ways to circumvent what i imagine the current trust model to be based on individual users blindly submitting reports and checking results its hard to imagine others havent as well as

date tue aug from valdiskletnieksvtedu messageid glpqkbturingpoliceccvtedu ever tried to get mh to not have a pseq sequence hmm ive been using mh for a long time since well before there were sequences and i dont think ive ever seen a pseq im guessing that thats the sequence that you have pick create as i recall it it has no default sequence name so the sequence names that people use will tend to vary from person to person wont they except as mh configurations move around institutions by osmosis ive always used sel for that purpose i kind of doubt that any pre builtin sequence name is going to be very general even unseen can be changed fortunately that one is easy to find in the mh profile though whether exmh does that os just uses unseen i havent bothered to find out kre _______________________________________________ exmhworkers mailing list exmhworkersredhatcom

as a practical matter i doubt the value sold in such situations ever adds up to the value lost and the nonpecuiary since of violation loss and trouble has to get in there somewhere if we are really picky i dont think considering marginal utility of dollars has value in this situation we arent debating whether the thief is better off he is im not a lawyer either i played one on tv once but i didnt play a very good one and they canceled it after the first episode the situtation i described came from my recollection of epsteins takings he was specifically rejecting the idea of absolute property right found in liberation theology and was using the idea that in an emergency where my life depends upon it im entitled to violate your property rights and more you are forbidden from using unreasonable force to defend them particularly if you arent around maybe i did get it all wrong but that particular recollection is relatively strong precisely because it gave a good reason why my libertarian theology needed to be modified he was also analyzing what the common law had come up with which might not be the statuatory law in a particular jurisdiction original message from forkadminxentcom mailtoforkadminxentcom on behalf of russell turpin sent monday august pm to forkspamassassintaintorg subject re david friedman mail me the money john hall the case against theft also acknowledges that the value to the thief is often far less than the value to the victim stealing my stereo and then fencing it for does not result in no loss to the economy overall that depends on the value placed on it by the fellow who buys it from the pawn shop and if you take into account the marginal utility of dollars the thief may value his lucre more than his victim on the flip side of this common law allows a breach of property law in precisely the type of scenarios where a net social gain is recorded but the owners availability to make a contract was problematic breaking into your isolated cabin because im starving for example is permissible if i later offer restitution for the damage i caused and the food i ate i am not a lawyer but i think this is an incorrect analysis of what the law allows in emergencies i can break into your cabin take your rifle grab a box of your ammo and shoot the bear that is mauling a poor hiker without having committed the crimes of breaking and entering theft hunting out of season and killing an endangered species whether or not i later offer to pay for your window and ammunition the law simply puts a higher priority on saving human life in emergency than on these other things now yes you can turn around and sue me for recompense but that is a civil issue not a criminal one crime requires mens rea and when i shot the bear i wasnt thinking about who owned the bullet _________________________________________________________________ msn photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos

this article from nytimescom has been sent to you by kharealumnicaltechedu axelrod eh the ecoli of social psychology nice to see our old friend still going strong prisoners dilemma is old enough to qualify for aarp membership regarding experimental design it is interesting that they used an allfemale panel and they included a mix of ages from and they used humans confederates computers as well as imitations the last two paragraphs are a rare sign of editorialized humor by an ny times bylined writer even still note the very large fig leaf the ceo joke is introduced in an ontherecord quote not that were talking about anything nearly as colorful as the economist rk kharealumnicaltechedu why were so nice were wired to cooperate july by natalie angier what feels as good as chocolate on the tongue or money in the bank but wont make you fat or risk a subpoena from the securities and exchange commission hard as it may be to believe in these days of infectious greed and sabers unsheathed scientists have discovered that the small brave act of cooperating with another person of choosing trust over cynicism generosity over selfishness makes the brain light up with quiet joy studying neural activity in young women who were playing a classic laboratory game called the prisoners dilemma in which participants can select from a number of greedy or cooperative strategies as they pursue financial gain researchers found that when the women chose mutualism over meism the mental circuitry normally associated with rewardseeking behavior swelled to life and the longer the women engaged in a cooperative strategy the more strongly flowed the blood to the pathways of pleasure the researchers performing their work at emory university in atlanta used magnetic resonance imaging to take what might be called portraits of the brain on hugs the results were really surprising to us said dr gregory s berns a psychiatrist and an author on the new report which appears in the current issue of the journal neuron we went in expecting the opposite the researchers had thought that the biggest response would occur in cases where one person cooperated and the other defected when the cooperator might feel that she was being treated unjustly instead the brightest signals arose in cooperative alliances and in those neighborhoods of the brain already known to respond to desserts pictures of pretty faces money cocaine and any number of licit or illicit delights its reassuring dr berns said in some ways it says that were wired to cooperate with each other the study is among the first to use mri technology to examine social interactions in real time as opposed to taking brain images while subjects stared at static pictures or thoughtprescribed thoughts it is also a novel approach to exploring an ancient conundrum why are humans so well nice why are they willing to cooperate with people whom they barely know and to do good deeds and to play fair a surprisingly high percentage of the time scientists have no trouble explaining the evolution of competitive behavior but the depth and breadth of human altruism the willingness to forgo immediate personal gain for the longterm common good far exceeds behaviors seen even in other largebrained highly social species like chimpanzees and dolphins and it has as such been difficult to understand ive pointed out to my students how impressive it is that you can take a group of young men and women of prime reproductive age have them come into a classroom sit down and be perfectly comfortable and civil to each other said dr peter j richerson a professor of environmental science and policy at the university of california at davis and an influential theorist in the field of cultural evolution if you put male and female chimpanzees that dont know each other into a lecture hall it would be a social explosion dr ernst fehr of the university of zurich and colleagues recently presented findings on the importance of punishment in maintaining cooperative behavior among humans and the willingness of people to punish those who commit crimes or violate norms even when the chastisers take risks and gain nothing themselves while serving as ad hoc police in her survey of the management of socalled commons in smallscale communities where villagers have the right for example to graze livestock on commonly held land dr elinor ostrom of indiana university found that all communities have some form of monitoring to gird against cheating or using more than a fair share of the resource in laboratory games that mimic smallscale commons dr richerson said to percent have to be coerced by a threat of punishment to cooperate fear alone is not highly likely to inspire cooperative behavior to the degree observed among humans if research like dr fehrs shows the stick side of the equation the newest findings present the neural carrot people cooperate because it feels good to do it in the new findings the researchers studied women from to years old many of them students at emory and inspired to participate by the promise of monetary rewards the scientists chose an allfemale sample because so few brainimaging studies have looked at only women most have been limited to men or to a mixture of men and women but there is a vast body of non imaging data that rely on using the prisoners dilemma its a simple and elegant model for reciprocity said dr james k rilling an author on the neuron paper who is at princeton its been referred to as the e coli of social psychology from past results the researchers said one can assume that neuro imaging studies of men playing the game would be similar to their new findings with women the basic structure of the trial had two women meet each other briefly ahead of time one was placed in the scanner while the other remained outside the scanning room the two interacted by computer playing about rounds of the game in every round each player pressed a button to indicate whether she would cooperate or defect her answer would be shown onscreen to the other player the monetary awards were apportioned after each round if one player defected and the other cooperated the defector earned and the cooperator nothing if both chose to cooperate each earned if both opted to defect each earned hence mutual cooperation from start to finish was a far more profitable strategy at a woman than complete mutual defection which gave each the risk that a woman took each time she became greedy for a little bit more was that the cooperative strategy would fall apart and that both would emerge the poorer in some cases both women were allowed to pursue any strategy that they chose in other cases the non scanned woman would be a confederate with the researchers instructed unbeknown to the scanned subject to defect after three consecutive rounds of cooperation the better to keep things less rarefied and pretty and more lifelike and gritty in still other experiments the woman in the scanner played a computer and knew that her partner was a machine in other tests women played a computer but thought that it was a human the researchers found that as a rule the freely strategizing women cooperated even occasional episodes of defection whether from free strategizers or confederates were not necessarily fatal to an alliance the social bond could be reattained easily if the defector chose to cooperate in the next couple of rounds another author of the report dr clinton d kilts said although the one who had originally been betrayed might be wary from then on as a result of the episodic defections the average perexperiment take for the participants was in the s some pairs though got locked into mutual defection dr rilling said analyzing the scans the researchers found that in rounds of cooperation two broad areas of the brain were activated both rich in neurons able to respond to dopamine the brain chemical famed for its role in addictive behaviors one is the anteroventral striatum in the middle of the brain right above the spinal cord experiments with rats have shown that when electrodes are placed in the striatum the animals will repeatedly press a bar to stimulate the electrodes apparently receiving such pleasurable feedback that they will starve to death rather than stop pressing the bar another region activated during cooperation was the orbitofrontal cortex in the region right above the eyes in addition to being part of the rewardprocessing system dr rilling said it is also involved in impulse control every round youre confronted with the possibility of getting an extra dollar by defecting he said the choice to cooperate requires impulse control significantly the reward circuitry of the women was considerably less responsive when they knew that they were playing against a computer the thought of a human bond but not mere monetary gain was the source of contentment on display in concert with the imaging results the women when asked afterward for summaries of how they felt during the games often described feeling good when they cooperated and expressed positive feelings of camaraderie toward their playing partners assuming that the urge to cooperate is to some extent innate among humans and reinforced by the brains feelgood circuitry the question of why it arose remains unclear anthropologists have speculated that it took teamwork for humanitys ancestors to hunt large game or gather difficult plant foods or rear difficult children so the capacity to cooperate conferred a survival advantage on our forebears yet as with any other trait the willingness to abide by the golden rule and to be a good citizen and not cheat and steal from ones neighbors is not uniformly distributed if we put some ceos in here id like to see how they respond dr kilts said maybe they wouldnt find a positive social interaction rewarding at all a prisoners dilemma indeed how to advertise for information on advertising in email

url date not supplied were trying to decide if fogbugz should support custom fields historically i am opposed to custom fields in principle because they get abused people add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to harvard end result people dont enter bugs which is much much worse than not capturing all that information you can always page fault to get the information if the original report forgot it rather than having a field in every bug where you enter the version numbers of every dll on your machine this is an actual customer request information which is likely to be relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs why not just have the programmerassignee look at the bug first and if they think it might be dllversionrelated only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking for the dll info similarly its always tempting to add a field in which you ask for the os version in which the bug occurred this sounds logical but trust me adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing only reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first place only a small percentage of bugs are really os dependant and you can always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be relevant but then how do you search for say all bugs which only happen on windows se aha you cant ever even with the custom field because not every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system so this search doesnt make sense in the first place the info wasnt captured do a full text search for se and youll find some of them life is imperfect life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of information a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in ram on the computer in question and while youre at it a photograph of the testers workspace but the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_ which all else being equal takes priority over making it easy to find them i have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking package was so highceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the system because they didnt know what all those fields were the _real_ bugtracking happened in email postits and hallway conversations great a pretty common question we get on the customer service line is does fogbugz support custom fields rather than giving our usual answer no on purpose over the last few weeks ive been saying can you please tell me what fields you would need were trying to decide whether to implement that feature in and we want to know why people need it the interesting thing is almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in fogbugz_ and the other ones in my educated opinion shouldnt be fields and in fact our existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields one of our biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company and i myself wanted to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design but i didnt and they never needed it even though they had been keeping track of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields and they are happy and keep buying more site licenses but the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in our product gosh even filemaker has custom fields righto its true and who am i to tell my customers they are wrong one person who i was talking to yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a builtin field for this would have made their database confusing and inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved but its still rude of me to tell customers that we dont have that feature _for their own good_ even though it usually is and were losing some sales because of it sigh i guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so hard to use that people dont use it at least we wont lose any sales

quoting nick murtagh nickmgoie on mon at rick moen wrote nonfreely redistributable apps in boxed sets sap database the same one as provided on wwwsapdborg which is released under the gpllgpl looking at it seems that sap went opensource some time in so my information likely was correct at the time i compiled that list in addition please note that just because a company decides to go open source with a codebase as of some new release version that doesnt make all versions ever released open source retroactively a licence attaches to a _copy_ of a creative work so if there was a proprietary nonredistributable copy in suse boxed sets its still proprietary and nonredistributable unless sap ag decided to mail out a separate permission grant for it irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

are buried at the bottom q your web site must be submitted to the search engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off its a bit like a ferris wheel you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on q understand the importance of keywords meta tags and titles employed when submitting your site to the search engines use the right ones and you go up get it wrong and you go to the bottom some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines wrong the problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get buried having your web

from the bbc website wwwbbccouk tuesday october gmt uk fake bank website cons victims west african criminals have used a fake version of a british banks online service to milk victims of cash say police the fake site was used to squeeze more money out of people they had already hooked the site has been shut down but uk national criminal intelligence service ncis said at least two canadians had lost more than after being taken in by the fake website the scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various african nations ncis said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would otherwise spot the scam convincing site news of this latest scam was revealed by bbc radiolive it found that an unclaimed web domain of a uk bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out their victims a ncis spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had the in front of the banks name i have seen the microsite myself and its very sophisticated said the ncis spokesman its very convincing especially to people not very experienced online once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down however the people behind it have not been caught ncis does know that at least two people have lost more than the bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again domain games usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as advanced fee or fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or email offering a share of any cash successfully moved out of africa the refers to the part of the nigerian penal code dealing with such crimes like any con there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash although this con has been practiced for years people still fall victim to it ncis estimates that up to five americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in london everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con cutting edge fraud often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of legitimacy people tricked into clicking on fake sites but a spokesman for ncis said fake or spoof websites are now being used in place of the certificates to many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web technology said the spokesman one of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the south african reserve bank the countrys national bank typically victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has been deposited in their name but before they can get their hands on the cash the victims are typically asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead once the south african police discovered the ruse they declared it a national priority crime and soon arrested the people behind it modern gloss an briefing paper prepared by ncis in august on organised crime noted that criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give old cons a modern gloss the ncis spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to fraud to come forward and help it track down the perpetrators he said in the last two months it had arrested people overseas involved with this type of fraud he said any email fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be true undoubtedly is one of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment service paypal conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and reenter their account and credit card details because paypal had lost the information the website link included in the email looked legitimate but in fact directed people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmens personal use yahoo groups sponsor sell a home for top to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteanaunsubscribeegroupscom your use of yahoo groups is subject to

what i understood was that the activists on the train refused to pay for the food and other items they acquired from the muslim vendors then taunted them that may not be true but it would put things in a more interesting light taking food from a small vendor in india and not paying them is trying to starve them it sounded consistent with the ideas and purpose of the train full of activists im rarely an apologist for muslims anywhere yet i find my sympathies with the muslims in this case even after they burned the train from forkadminxentcom mailtoforkadminxentcom on behalf of stephen d williams the pity of it is that some muslims were ready to give it to them their murderous attack on the trainload of vhp activists at godhra with its awful atavistic echoes of the killings of hindus and muslims by the trainload during the partition riots of played right into the hindu extremists hands

hi all ive decided at last to test the alsa sound drivers as usual the result is that ive spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality people seem to think it outputs but hey some of you will benefit from that right ive got the whole thing working on a valhalla system but the packages should easily install or at least recompile on enigma limbonull and maybe others who knows here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out recompile the alsadriver source rpm for your running kernel you can install the binary package if youre using the i install this alsadriver package install the alsalibs package install the alsautils package now go to this url and find out what you need to change in your etcmodulesconf file to replace the default oss driver loading very complete and very good documentation hopefully youll see that your card is supported reboot or remove by hand your current sound modules youll probably need to stop many applications to free the sound resource by hand and insert the new ones if all is well youve got alsa working dmesg to check is a good idea you now just need to adjust the volume levels with eg aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default with aplay you can already test files to see if you hear anything you can also install the xmms plugin seems to make my xmms segfault on exit hmmm but maybe its another plugin to listen to your good ol mp files thats it it really isnt complicated and has never been from what i see the only thing i disliked was to have to install from source but as i cant imagine myself doing that ive repackaged everything cleanly even the dev entries are included in the rpm package and not created by an ugly post script i insist and seamlessly integrate into the etcmakedevd structure there are also a few other noticeable differences with the default provided alsa spec files for example ive split alsalibs development files into an alsalibdevel package and included static libraries there are others of course oh yes the kernel version against which the alsadriver package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the rpm release so does the architecture im open to any comments or suggestions about these packages download current spec files all others patches etc matthias ps as an extra bonus ive also recompiled xine with alsa support simply run xine a alsa and off you go it may even support and spdif clean custom red hat linux rpm packages red hat linux release valhalla running linux kernel load ac online battery charging _______________________________________________ rpmlist mailing list rpmlistfreshrpmsnet

mr fork writes files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the internet as with napster or freenet in fact the caching in xdegrees is more sophisticated than it is on those systems users with high bandwidth connections can download portions or stripes of a file from several cached locations simultaneously the xdegrees software then reassembles these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that the downloaded file is the same as the original a key component of this digital signature is a digest of the file which is stored as an http header for the file this more sophisticated than napster or freenet part seems to be the same behavior implemented in many other pp cdns such as kazaa edonkeyovernet bittorrent gnutella with huge extensions onionnetworks webraid though the quality of the digest used by each system varies wildly gordon

gary lawrence murphy said i envy some of those posting to this list ive been in business for years and i havent yet had the luxury of writing every line of code for any project we are always coerced by budgets and time to maximize the amount of work done elsewhere for consultancy integration or open source work sure perl python or java with free use of external libs makes a lot of sense imo i should note that normally when ive used c or c in the past its dictated by the fact that i would be working on a commercial product written from the ground up where the code youre generating is important ip for the company in this case using a thirdparty lib often is not an option or would be a pita licensingwise also cutting out thirdparty dependencies can reduce the risk of oops there goes the company that makes that library i depend on now to shop around for something vaguely similar figure out what bugs its got rewrite my code to use the new api and hope for the best this can be a very big deal for obvious reasons open source knockers should note that this is not a problem when using lgpld libs j

endeavors technology inc has teamed with web meetings leader webex communicationsinc to help professionals make better use of corporate time and resources and gain competitive advantage by integrating the advanced communications capabilities of the webex platform with endeavors secure pp collaboration network endeavors has created a new method of worldclass teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel with the rapid growth in popularity of web meetings the rationale for this worldclass relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience between online meetings the issue by those preferring not to travel is how to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between meetings rather than depending on intermittent insecure email and multiple copies of constantly changing documents intermeeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium independent of time in asynchronous mode a team member can access read and edit information relevant to the meeting group at hisher convenience rather than having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others a secured environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also essential endeavors magi technology converts the web into a secure platform for sharing information directly from peoples desktops webex meetings can be recorded and reviewed at any time documents shared in the meeting can be actioned in realtime or at a later date calendars and project schedules can be updated at any time and new individuals added to the workgroup at will all in a secure environment with people working across the globe inside or outside company firewalls magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to web meeting participants not only can they share and access information at will but they can also know which other participants are online or present this enables them to chat and message

original message from forkadminxentcom mailtoforkadminxentcomon behalf of robert harley sent monday september am to forkspamassassintaintorg subject re java is for kiddies reza bfar wrote this thread kind of surprises me i started coding with c then c and moved on to java and i think that robert harley wrote looks like a case of my experience is comprehensive yours is anecdotal they dont know what theyre talking about well i sure dont claim that i think most people on fork probably have more programming knowledge than i do theres lots of experience out here reza bfar wrote the people who pay the wages dont give a flyin heck what programming language you write things in they just want it to work robert harley wrote in my experience they do care it has to work certainly and in particular it has to work with what theyve already got and it has to work on clients systems my limited experience of java started a few years ago when support on linux was so terrible that i ran away screaming and havent come back yet well i think until recently support for most things on linux was kind of shady things have got much better youre right in that the jdk used to suck on linux but then imho linux is still maturing or at least development tools for linux are maturing ive been developing a few server side apps that run on linux recently with jdk x and theyve had no problems with great performance robert harley worte microsoft has announced that they plan to remove java from windows they took it out of xp already and it has to be installed with a service pack somehow i cant imagine them removing the ability to run c programs hmmm do you really think that ms is pulling out java because its a bad programming language or application platform you dont think this has anything to do with net being a competitor to java do you or that ms has basically copied java with some additional features and called it c isnt that alone an indication that they actually do think that a vm is the right way to go for most high level applications reza bfar wrote c and c forces the developer to solve problems such as memory management over and over again robert harley wrote cant say i spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management issues apart from the fact that i frequently need gb hmmm again youre telling me that youve never had a nasty bug that took you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak i am not the best cc programmer not even close but ive known really good ones and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory management however occasional they may be its about design patterns architecture high level stuff robert harley wrote if your problem just requires application of a design pattern to solve then its trivial anyway irrespective of language wow so youre telling me that unless the application involves bitcounting its trivial what about the application itself what about high level problems such as task distribution workflow etc arent most high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal cc code for example do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks there are lots of them on this list are working on writing an operating system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment i am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low level problems that have been solved million times over and over and over again robert harley wrote you appear to be gratuitously asserting that c programmers waste time on irrelevant lowlevel problems and java programmers dont depends entirely on the programmer not the language i can see how you could infer this however what i believe to really be the case is that java is one of the best languages for writing large applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more than three programmers in those cases its always very hard to get the programmers to agree on apis memory management techniques etc with java the jcp takes care of the discussions so that you dont sit around in a long meeting trying to decide what api to use to hook up to a database jdbc or a messaging bus jms java is not just a programming language its also a platform robert harley wrote buzzword yikes have you written db code with cc for different databases just an example tried porting a persistence layer from windows to unix say you have informix running on solaris and you want to port to windows with ms sql bad ideabut for the sake of the example would you rather deal with jdbc port or cc port that uses informix drivers and now you have to use odbc a monolithic set of apis or a crap load of different apis slicing and dicing the same problems different ways robert harley wrote unsupported assertion so are you saying that there is a standard set of apis for cc for everything aside to the minimal ansi stuff is there a standard way of dealing with cc applications for various domain problems messaging database persistence etc that rivals java id like to know if there is one accepted by everyone who writes cc in that case i claim ignorance not suggesting that java is the golden hammer just that cc is overkill for most things i even coded in vb but vb is a true disgrace to programming its just lame java is object oriented no flamemail from the antioo people please that is a religious discussion and relatively clean and i dont think that every kid can write a well designed java program kids typically dont understand various design patterns and principles to my experience they actually tend to think more of the low level problems wanting to rewrite and reinvent the world a tendency that is much more possible imho in cc than in java due to existence of standard apis

from donald eastlake rd deetorquepotholecom july by yonder blessed moon sleuths decode life and art by leon jaroff on its way back from the pacific island of tinian where it had delivered the uranium core for the atomic bomb that destroyed hiroshima the heavy cruiser indianapolis was torpedoed by the japanese submarine i and sent to the bottom of the philippine sea it was one of the worst disasters in american naval history only of its nearly crew members survived now experts at southwest texas state university have given that tragic story a startling new twist it was the moon they say that sank the indianapolis or anyway they write in the july issue of sky telescope it was the moon that made the sinking possible using astronomical computer programs records and weather reports as well as the known coordinates and running speeds of the ship and the submarine that sank it the authors determined that when the i surfaced it was perfectly aligned west to east with the cruiser and they said a threequarter moon had just emerged from behind the clouds looking across the moonlit water an i crewman spotted the ship silhouetted against the sky miles away half an hour later six torpedoes sent it to the bottom it was sheer chance said dr donald olson an astronomer without that alignment with the moon the lookouts would not have spotted the cruiser especially at that distance with russell doescher a physics lecturer dr olson conducts a university honors course called astronomy in art history and literature in the last years he has pinpointed the time and place of the rendering of art masterpieces given new interpretations of astronomical references in chaucer and revealed the decisive role of the moon in military and other encounters two years ago for example dr olson turned his attention to the bright star in van goghs white house at night he and some students went to auvers france where van gogh created his final works and searched until they found the house largely unchanged sifting through letters from van gogh to his brother dr olson found that the painting was completed in june noting the orientation of the house in the painting he determined where van gogh had set his easel and what section of the sky he had portrayed and from the lighting and shadows he established that the house had been illuminated by the setting sun his computer analysis then identified the star it was venus which in early evening in midjune had occupied that part of the sky a final check of local weather records pinpointed the actual date van gogh had composed the painting june the only clear day in the middle of the month that year dr olson has also turned his attention to shakespeare intrigued by the opening of hamlet when guards on the ramparts of elsinor refer to the star thats westward from the pole had made his course to illume that part of heaven where now it burns from the guards description the season and the time other astronomers had suggested several bright stars as possibilities but dr olsons calculations placed it in the constellation cassiopeia which lacks any notably luminous stars pondering this problem on a trip with his wife dr olson was suddenly inspired he was aware that in a supernova called tychos star for the danish astronomer tycho brahe suddenly flamed in cassiopeia creating a worldwide sensation shakespeare at the time would certainly have recalled the event and his memory was probably refreshed by the description of the supernova in a history book that was the source of some of his bestknown plays dr olson has no doubt that the star that glared above elsinor that night was tychos and he has an impressive record of other astronomybased sleuthing aware that the photographer ansel adams often neglected to date his negatives dr olson set out to find when adams had shot his classic moon and half dome at yosemite dr olson and his students found adamss vantage point studied the location phase and features of the moon in the photograph plus the shadows on the dome snow on the peak and other clues and then announced that the picture had been taken at pm dec then dr olson calculated that the setting would be virtually identical at pm on dec on that day adamss daughterinlaw visited yosemite and was photographed holding a print of moon and the half dome in the foreground of an eerily similar view of the actual moon and the half dome analyzing chaucers works dr olson has confirmed that a particularly rapid movement of the moon described in the merchants tale occurred in april and in the franklins tale chaucers description of the heavenly alignment that caused an exceptionally high tide on the brittany coast convinced dr olson that chaucer was an advanced amateur astronomer then there was paul revere on his way to saddle up for his famous ride how did he manage to row undetected past a british warship on a moonlit night in boston harbor dr olsons computer program revealed that while the moon was nearly full that night it was unusually close to the southern horizon and did not illuminate reveres boat dr olsons proudest achievement was explaining the tide that failed in the bloody marine corps landing at tarawa atoll on nov planners had expected a tide to provide a water depth of five feet over a reef some yards from shore allowing larger landing craft with drafts of at least four feet to pass but that day and the next in the words of some observers the ocean just sat there providing neither low tide nor high tide and leaving a mean depth of three feet over the reef the craft grounded on the edge of the reef and many marines were killed or injured as they waded yards to the shore rifles over their heads in the face of machinegun fire from the japanese asked by a former marine about the tidal phenomenon dr olson spent six months researching and mastering tidal theory and discovered that the military planners were aware that they had to contend with a neap tide this phenomenon occurs twice a month when the moon is near its first or last quarter because the countering tug of the sun causes water levels to deviate less but that day the moon was also almost at its farthest point from earth and exerted even less pull leaving the waters relatively undisturbed and the marines in trouble im not in the least blaming the planners dr olson said explaining that the techniques used in accurately determining tides hadnt been applied to the waters at tarawa indeed he modestly claims by using his computer program we can calculate the tides in any port in the world on any day in history yet dr olsons greatest satisfaction seems to stem from his interdisciplinary approach to astronomical sleuthing i have thought about van gogh about shakespeare and chaucer he says and that has made my life as a scientist much richer

on the way to telluride on my way back to the world dear friends i go to turn my computer on but i have forgotten where the onoff switch is i have had this laptop for three years but i havent turned it on for the past two months i look on its left side i feel around the back i find it on the right and i feel like an idiot the screen reads fatal error and offers to save whatever i had typed on it last june st a few weeks before my mother died i hit ctlaltdel and it is gone gone gone like this long sad summer frozen now and nothing seemingly matters but everything matters more now than ever before why did she have to die when will this pain stop i got up this morning to fly out to colorado the telluride film festival is screening my film tomorrow night the first time it will be shown in the united states my mother did not get to see this new film she was always so proud of everything i did cheering me on every day from the day where my memory begins i had shown an early cut of the film to my friends last winter in my parents living room and mom would come in and out of the room catching a scene here and there saying boy thats something isnt it i dont feel right right now i have avoided most people for the past two months i cant conceive in my mind having to face a crowd of strangers no matter how supportive or appreciative they may be everyone says to me it will be good to get back to work good to be busy take my mind off my sadness as if not aware that what i really might need is for it to be the other way around at my familys insistence i tried going on tv a few weeks ago to talk about the corporate crooks roaming our great land i had decided to give it a try and gave it my best shot and ended up feeling so empty and more alone i had agreed to go on crossfire and donahue thank god for this guy on the condition that i would not have to have one of those stupid cable news shouting matches with three rightwingnuts where no one can hear or wants to hear whats being said they agreed to the terms but as bob novak asked his first question about arent my true motives to destroy capitalism and make america a socialist country i just sat there for a moment and didnt respond i thought i would just take the microphone off and leave who needs these fs but then my dad was with me in the studio and i looked over at him and smiled and then into the camera i said yes bob that is exactly what i intend to do and considering more people have bought my book than any other nonfiction book in america this year i guess that means that the majority of americans agree with me on this point so look out bob cause were going to seize your money first i asked the studio audience in dc for a show of hands of all those who agreed and i was later told that numerous hands shot up in the air much to the chagrin of a stunned bob novak i also added that i thought the pope was onto something when he said that capitalism is a sin my dad liked that he is a sweet strong smart man and i loved the drive with him back home we took a spin through the michigan state campus and he told me how he had come down here after world war ii to inquire about going to college but thought it best to return to the assembly line where he had a secure job his years during the war serving in the marines were going to be counted toward his seniority and so he worked the spark plug and oil filter assembly line for years and provided for mom and us kids and gave us all his love which of course mattered the most dad took me to the airport this morning remarking on the way how much mom would have enjoyed this simple trip across town to bishop airport how happy she would have been knowing that i was heading off on a new journey in my very fortunate life i thought about how she came to new york for the screening of roger me at the new york film festival in and how i got to introduce her and my aunt as they sat in the front of the balcony and how mom and aunt lois stood and took a long lincoln center bow and how i stood on that stage and felt that she deserved every bit of that applause and more its a bittersweet memory now as ive just found out that the nyff selection committee this year is too afraid to show my new film politics is what i have been told too populist for the new elite who now sit in judgment of what is art they dont want to help further your platform mike a person close to the committee tells me one of them even said i know this film is going to be popular and i dont personally want to contribute to its popularity so it was decided that bowling for columbine a cannes prizewinner knighted by the chicago tribune as one of the most effective politicalpolemical films ever a film chosen by every single film festival around the world this fall no this film must not be shown at lincoln center just six blocks from the edit room where we made it blocks north of ground zero ive gone too far this time cut too close to the bone stuck my lens where it doesnt belong right straight through the heart of an america that is both master and victim of the ultraviolence it is so sad to see this place where i will always remember my mother taking that bow now cowering to the whims of neos who like their counterparts in hollywood preside over the demolition of a once great art form my dad drops me off and goes to park in the shortterm lot he comes inside just as the airport personnel are taking everything out of my suitcase for inspection they dont ask to see the print of the film the only thing i might have had on me that is poised to do any real damage to all the right people of course my dad and i stop short of the metal detectors and the next round of inspectors who are anxious to look at my smelly feet we hug and he kisses me and i am trying hard so very hard to not break down in the middle of this airport he tells me not to worry about him and i tell him ill call him from detroit when i am changing planes i go through security and as i am being taken aside to be searched again i look back and see him still standing there watching out for me my dad im on the plane and im thirsty but i took the water bottle out of my bag when i packed it this morning the bottle halfdrank had been sitting untouched in my untouched bag since i stuck it in there the night we had to rush my mom to the hospital the bottle was still there in that overnight bag where i put my tshirt and sweatpants the ones i had on for the night and day i sat by my mothers side in the hospital as she struggled to live holding her hand holding her head trying to comfort her strands of hair on my sweater i can see the stains from where my tears and mucus ran uncontrollably down my face and onto that sweater the doctor said she had an chance of making it an hour before she died another doctor said the chances were in that was good enough for me one in one hundred ive had those odds i won dont let her die please do everything you can do dont let her die the priest came then another priest came and when the priests left my dad asked us three kids and the three grandkids to all join hands and say our goodbyes to mom say whatever we wanted to about what she meant to us i am sorry i can not complete this paragraph right now i cant see the screen through the tearsmaybe someday the night before we rushed her to the hospital i had a little surprise planned for her i had brought a copy of my new movie and i was going to show it to her as the end credits would roll she would get to see what she has seen at the end of all of my work her name along with my dads in that list of creditsand to me its the only real credit that ever mattered because without them i would not have the life they gave me the way they raised me it is all a privilege i will never cease being thankful for i never got to show her the movie that night mike she called out from the porch in a pitch of voice i had never heard get your father i dont feel good she was without warning dying within hours she would be gone im walking through the detroit airport to gate for the flight to denver and i hear someone say ok mr stuckup just walk right on by i turn to see it is one of anchors from the local tv station in flint i apologize my sunglasses are on i have been crying since i left my dad at the flint airport i explain this to her and she starts to get tears in her eyes my mom died in october she says and i realize that this pain that feels so solitary is truthfully a shared experience amongst us all no one is immune from this loss but instead of taking the time to tell me about how rough it has been for her she asks about how i am doing and how is my dad doing and did we get the flowers she and the others sent she gives me her number and says to call anytime if i feel the need to talk at that moment i remember what she told me that her mother also died this year and i think man get over yourself mike you are not alone in this and so i ask her how she is doing i think a lot she says about all the things she wont see my two children grow up to do to be but i believe she is in my heart right here right now and she will see it all they call my flight and i rush over to the payphone to call my dad to see if he got home ok he tells me that when he left the short term lot he got talking to the person in the tollbooth who told him about her mother getting cancer and how she was caring for her she said that her bill in the hospital came to he says with astonishment they wont be able to pay it she makes six dollars an hour no health insurance i gave her a tip along with the toll you gave the tollbooth worker a tip well you have to that person could be you or me that is my father that was my mother yours michael moore

how were these msgs broken up into the sets set in particular is giving the other sets severe problems and set blows the fn rate on everything its predicting when the rates across runs within a training set vary by as much as a factor of it suggests there was systematic bias in the way the sets were chosen for example perhaps they were broken into sets by arrival time if thats what you did you should go back and break them into sets randomly instead if you did partition them randomly the wild variance across runs is mondo mysterious they werent partitioned in any particular scheme i think ill write a reshuffler and move them all around just in case fwiw im using mh style folders with numbered files means you can just use mh tools to manipulate the sets for whatever reason there appear to be few of those in brucegs spam collection i added code to strip uuencoded sections and pump out uuencode summary tokens instead ill check it in it didnt make a significant difference on my usual test run a single spam in my set is now judged as ham by the other sets nothing else changed it does shrink the database size here by a few percent let us know whether it helps you ill give it a go anthony baxter anthonyinterlinkcomau its never too late to have a happy childhood

is there a relatively clean way to dynamically build comp files based on the path of the current folder yeah i know exmh will pull the first comp in the path up from the current folder to the mail root but thats not what i want im starting to use plus addressing heavily as part of my spam controls specifically i each mailing list with a listspecific address eg i would subscribe to this list as clawexmhkanganu or perhaps clawexmhuserskanganu instead of clawkanganu however to do this i need a new set of comp files for each list folder as im subscribed to something just over lists thats rather a pain i really dont want to go create and maintain comp files components replcomps replgroupcomps especially not as i suspect ill be changing or adapting my naming pattern a few times as i adapt various supporting tools what would be great is if i could build the relevant comp file dynamically at runtime that way i dont need to maintain a couple thousand comp files i just need to make my plus addresses predictablecomputable based say on the folder path eg im currently in folder listsproductsexmhl the script would dynamically build a compfile which had a from of clawexmhkanganu for repl comp etc similarly when in folder listslinuxsvlugl id get a from of clawsvlugkanganu that way i can use lookup tables for those folders which have multiple lists being delivered into them any ideas how this might be done in an automaticmaintainable fashion it would be more than good enough if all i had to do was drop a tiny from_header file in each folder that somehow got picked up by the comp file j c lawrence satan oscillate my metallic sonatas clawkanganu he lived as a devil eh evil is a name of a foeman as i live _______________________________________________ exmhusers mailing list exmhusersredhatcom

on september tim peters said would people be interested in the script id be happy to extricate it from my local modules and check it into cvs sure i think its relevant but maybe for another purpose paul svensson is thinking harder about real people wink than the rest of us and he may be able to get use out of approaches that identify closely related spam for example some amount of spam is going to end up in the ham training data in real life use and any sort of similarity score to a piece of known spam may be an aid in finding and purging it otoh look into dcc distributed checksum clearinghouse which uses fuzzy checksums its quite likely that dccs checksumming scheme is better than something any of us would throw together for personal use no offense skip but i have no personal experience of it greg greg ward gwardpythonnet if it cant be expressed in figures it is not scienceit is opinion

anthony baxter well ive finally got around to pulling down the sf code starting with it and absolutely zero local modifications i see the following how many runs is this summarizing for each how many hamspam were in the training set how many in the prediction sets what were the error rates run ratespy over your output file the effect of set sizes on accuracy rates isnt known ive informally reported some results from just a few controlled experiments on that jeremy reported improved accuracy by doubling the training set size but that wasnt a controlled experiment things besides just training set size changed between before and after ham distribution for all runs items spam distribution for all runs items my next current task is to complete the corpus ive got its currently got ham spam and about currently unsorted im tossing up using either hammie or spamassassin to do the initial sort previously ive used various forms of grep for keywords and a little gui thing to pop a message up and let me say spamham but thats just getting too too tedious yup tagging data is mondo tedious and mistakes hurt i expect hammie will do a much better job on this already than hand grepping be sure to stare at the false positives and get the spam out of there i cant make it available en masse but i will look at finding some of the more interesting uglies one thing ive seen consider this anecdotal for now is that the skip tokens end up in a _lot_ of the fps with probabilities favoring ham or spam a skip token is produced in lieu of word more than chars long and without any highbit characters its possible that they helped me because raw html produces lots of these however if youre running current cvs tokenizerretain_pure_html_tags defaults to false now so html decorations should vanish before body tokenization

politicians worldwide are discovering the internet what a great tool for fascism once you got the laws in place to solve that whole anonymity thing also i notice this story shows the truth the canadian government is really located in washington dc ottawa is just a branch office come to think of it the last story i posted about canada featured the head of its military speaking to us from military hq in palm beach florida owen will canadas isps become spies by declan mccullagh mailtodeclanmccullaghcnetcom staff writer cnet newscom august pm pt washingtonthe canadian government is considering a proposal that would force internet providers to rewire their networks for easy surveillance by police and spy agencies a discussion draft released sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every canadian with an internet account a plan that could sharply curtail the right to be anonymous online the canadian government including the department of justice and industry canada wrote the page blueprint as a nearfinal step in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to conduct electronic surveillance a proposed law based on the discussion draft is expected to be introduced in parliament late this year or in early arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and combat even runofthemill crimes they also claim that by enacting these proposals canada will be following its obligations under the council of europes cybercrime treaty which the country is in the process of considering if the discussion draft were to become law it would outlaw the possession of computer viruses authorize police to order internet providers to retain logs of all web browsing for up to six months and permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find hidden electronic and digital devices that a suspect might be concealing in most circumstances a court order would be required for government agents to conduct internet monitoring canada and the united states are nonvoting members of the council of europe and representatives from both countries police agencies have endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty which has drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups of nearly participating nations only albania has formally adopted or ratified the treaty michael geist a professor at the university of ottawa who specializes in ecommerce law says that the justification for adopting such sweeping changes to canadian law seems weak it seems to me that the main justification theyve given for all the changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to make changes geist said to me thats not a particularly convincing argument if there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority make that case geist added that theres nothing in the document that indicates new powers are needed i dont know that there have been a significant number of cases where police have run into problems probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is compelling internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and dataretention orders the united states has a similar requirement called the communications assistance for law enforcement act but it applies only to preinternet telecommunications companies it is proposed that all service providers wireless wireline and internet be required to ensure that their systems have the technical capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national security agencies according to the proposal companies would be responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment sarah andrews an analyst at the electronic privacy information center epic who specializes in international law says the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies their proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers not just internet providers andrews said the cybercrime treaty deals only with computer data epic opposes the cybercrime treaty saying it grants too much power to police and does not adequately respect privacy rights another section of the proposal says the canadian association of chiefs of police recommends the establishment of a national database with personal information about all canadian internet users the implementation of such a database would presuppose that service providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information the draft says gus hosein a visiting fellow at the london school of economics and an activist with privacy international calls the database a dumb idea immediately you have to wonder if youre allowed to use anonymous mobile phones or whether youre allowed to connect to the internet anonymously hosein said a representative for george radwanski canadas privacy commissioner said the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not have any comments on the paper as it stands comments on the proposal can be sent to laaljusticegcca mailtolaaljusticegcca no later than nov

the main reason id like to stick with a milterbased approach is the ability to reject messages at the smtp stage this way the recipient isnt bothered and the sender knows immediately that the message failed my understanding is that once it gets to procmail as far as the sender is concerned it got through and since all our users connect via pop moving things to another folder is not an option so the only way to notify the recipient is to allow the message through or replace it with a summary i think the summary thingy with a mail based retreive facility is a good alternative you avoid false positive only one email to list all the spam you received in one day and you have full per user pref olivier this sfnet email is sponsored bythinkgeek welcome to geek heaven _______________________________________________ spamassassintalk mailing list spamassassintalklistssourceforgenet

its monday september student life begins with linux by john sterne the launch last month of a marketing special interest group by the irish linux users group ilug open source and marketing it seems might not be mutually exclusive concepts has already sparked an interesting initiative at university college cork when the new academic year begins at ucc every incoming student will be offered a copy of red hat linux ilug member braun brelin proposed this promotion when he ran a training class for staff at the ucc computer science department brelin who is the director of technology at openapp says that the linux offer could be extended to any or all of the other irish universities the user group is tapping into an international red hat programme that aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source style of computing the linux distributor runs an educational channel to reach this audience bundling educational software with its operating environment and offering networked support services to eligible applicants this scheme was originally designed to suit the educational structures in the us but is now available to schools and universities throughout the world red hat linux incorporates ease of use and maintenance features and is intended to counter objections that linux is hard to master on personal systems the linuxforall project at ucc could also raise the profile of red hat ireland based in cork this operation has run shared financial services for other red hat offices in europe since until now its involvement with users in ireland has been fairly limited although it does sometimes refer them to other red hat offices in europe that offer consulting or technical support services david owens red hats director of global logistics and production sees the formation of the ilug marketing group as a reason to take a more proactive approach in the last three months he notes his office in cork has received more and more calls from irish companies that are interested in adopting linux and has introduced some to red hat presales consultants many thanks are due to braun and david for working together on this one regards l irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

john gay wrote looking into these things as isaid the pgcc site does not seem to have been updated in at least a year or more i am also looking into gcc itself now that the series is out it might be better than when the pgcc patches were written gcc has been as good as or better than pgcc for quite a while pgcc was was written back in the days when gcc splintered due to a perception of slow progress on the main branch a number of linux distributions wound up using egcs partly derived from the pgcc work as i recall happiness was restored to the world with gcc and later the bottom line is pentiums have better instruction sets than the original instructions that they still support not really no the only instruction of consequence to gcc anyway since the i was the cmov introduced with the pentium pro gcc will use that instruction if directed to with marchpentiumpro and you will generally get a few percent improvement out of it code compiled with that option will fail on pentium and earlier processors the pentium also started introducing pipelining so properly generated code can be upto faster than equivulent code that performs the same function thats the art of instruction scheduling rearranging the instructions generated by the compiler such that they make best use of the parallel superscalar pipelines present in a modern cpu gcc has a fair go at scheduling according to the mcpupentiumpentiumpro option gcc does a better job and fine tunes for a few more processors such as athlon and athlonxp theyre in the process of replacing the compilers instruction scheduling with a whole new mechanism that should do an even better job but thats a ways down the road yet in gcc as for the exotic extra instructions sets gcc will make use of sse or sse instructions instead of instructions if you use the mfpmathsse option and you may see some speed benefit from it but theres a chance you may also see incompatibilities gcc will still use i code for missing functionality in the sse instruction set double precision floats for example afaik no current gcc will ever use mmx or dnow instructions though gcc enables user code to explicitly generate these instructions with c code the kernel sometimes uses these instruction sets to get superfast block copies of memory or raid math but not much else not sure what improvements the p introduce i think its mostly just speed improvements rather than any execution changes p introduced sse a _much_ improved version of sse and a viable replacement for i fpu code sse supports only single precision floats while sse can handle doubles mmx and sse shared registers with the fpu which hobbles them a bit but sse has its own large dedicated register file so far p is the only cpu equipped with sse amds x cpus are said to have it as well of course x itself is a whole other ball game paul irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

bridge conn here in southern new england the corn is already waist high and growing so avidly you can almost hear the creak of stalk and leaf as the plants stretch toward the sun the ears of sweet corn are just starting to show up on local farm stands inaugurating one of the ceremonies of an american summer these days the nations nearly millionacre field of corn rolls across the countryside like a second great lawn but this wholesome allamerican image obscures a decidedly more dubious reality like the tulip the apple and the potato zea mays the botanical name for both sweet and feed corn has evolved with humans over the past years or so in the great dance of species we call domestication the plant gratifies human needs in exchange for which humans expand the plants habitat moving its genes all over the world and remaking the land clearing trees plowing the ground protecting it from its enemies so it might thrive corn by making itself tasty and nutritious got itself noticed by christopher columbus who helped expand its range from the new world to europe and beyond today corn is the worlds most widely planted cereal crop but nowhere have humans done quite as much to advance the interests of this plant as in north america where zea mays has insinuated itself into our landscape our food system and our federal budget one need look no further than the billion farm bill president bush signed last month to wonder whose interests are really being served here under the year program taxpayers will pay farmers billion a year to grow ever more corn this despite the fact that we struggle to get rid of the surplus the plant already produces the average bushel of corn pounds sells for about today it costs farmers more than to grow it but rather than design a program that would encourage farmers to plant less corn which would have the benefit of lifting the price farmers receive for it congress has decided instead to subsidize corn by the bushel thereby insuring that zea mays dominion over its square mile american habitat will go unchallenged at first blush this subsidy might look like a handout for farmers but really its a form of welfare for the plant itself and for all those economic interests that profit from its overproduction the processors factory farms and the soft drink and snack makers that rely on cheap corn for zea mays has triumphed by making itself indispensable not to farmers whom it is swiftly and surely bankrupting but to the archer daniels midlands tysons and cocacolas of the world our entire food supply has undergone a process of cornification in recent years without our even noticing it thats because unlike in mexico where a cornbased diet has been the norm for centuries in the united states most of the corn we consume is invisible having been heavily processed or passed through food animals before it reaches us most of the animals we eat chickens pigs and cows today subsist on a diet of corn regardless of whether it is good for them in the case of beef cattle which evolved to eat grass a corn diet wreaks havoc on their digestive system making it necessary to feed them antibiotics to stave off illness and infection even farmraised salmon are being bred to tolerate corn not a food their evolution has prepared them for why feed fish corn because its the cheapest thing you can feed any animal thanks to federal subsidies but even with more than half of the billion bushels of corn produced annually being fed to animals there is plenty left over so companies like adm cargill and conagra have figured ingenious new ways to dispose of it turning it into everything from ethanol to vitamin c and biodegradable plastics by far the best strategy for keeping zea mays in business has been the development of highfructose corn syrup which has all but pushed sugar aside since the s most soft drink manufacturers have switched from sugar to corn sweeteners as have most snack makers nearly percent of the calories americans consume now come from corn sweeteners the figure is percent for many children add to that all the cornbased animal protein cornfed beef chicken and pork and the corn qua corn chips muffins sweet corn and you have a plant that has become one of natures greatest success stories by turning us along with several other equally unwitting species into an expanding race of corn eaters so why begrudge corn its phenomenal success isnt this the way domestication is supposed to work the problem in corns case is that were sacrificing the health of both our bodies and the environment by growing and eating so much of it though were only beginning to understand what our cornified food system is doing to our health theres cause for concern its probably no coincidence that the wholesale switch to corn sweeteners in the s marks the beginning of the epidemic of obesity and type diabetes in this country sweetness became so cheap that soft drink makers rather than lower their prices supersized their serving portions and marketing budgets thousands of new sweetened snack foods hit the market and the amount of fructose in our diets soared this would be bad enough for the american waistline but theres also preliminary research suggesting that highfructose corn syrup is metabolized differently than other sugars making it potentially more harmful a recent study at the university of minnesota found that a diet high in fructose as compared to glucose elevates triglyceride levels in men shortly after eating a phenomenon that has been linked to an increased risk of obesity and heart disease little is known about the health effects of eating animals that have themselves eaten so much corn but in the case of cattle researchers have found that cornfed beef is higher in saturated fats than grassfed beef we know a lot more about what million acres of corn is doing to the health of our environment serious and lasting damage modern corn hybrids are the greediest of plants demanding more nitrogen fertilizer than any other crop corn requires more pesticide than any other food crop runoff from these chemicals finds its way into the groundwater and in the midwestern corn belt into the mississippi river which carries it to the gulf of mexico where it has already killed off marine life in a square mile area to produce the chemicals we apply to our cornfields takes vast amounts of oil and natural gas nitrogen fertilizer is made from natural gas pesticides from oil americas corn crop might look like a sustainable solarpowered system for producing food but it is actually a huge inefficient polluting machine that guzzles fossil fuel a half a gallon of it for every bushel so it seems corn has indeed become king we have given it more of our land than any other plant an area more than twice the size of new york state to keep it well fed and safe from predators we douse it with chemicals that poison our water and deepen our dependence on foreign oil and then in order to dispose of all the corn this cracked system has produced we eat it as fast as we can in as many ways as we can turning the fat of the land into well fat one has to wonder whether corn hasnt at last succeeded in domesticating us michael pollan is the author most recently of the botany of desire a plantseye view of the world

measurements of atmospheric temperatures for almost all regions of the earth including remote deserts rain forests and oceans for which reliable temperature data are not otherwise available the accuracy and reliability of temperature data gathered by the satellites since january has been confirmed by comparing the satellite data to independent temperature data a recent study found a percent agreement between the msu data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations once the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed it is placed in a public computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the us and abroad it has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change and is cited in reports from the intergovernmental panel on climate change gathering the data while traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere each of the more than readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than cubic kilometers of air the msu makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere the intensity of the microwave emissions their brightness varies according to temperature christy and spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset verifying the accuracy of msu measurements a recent comparison of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons found a remarkable level of agreement between the two to verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units christy compared temperature readings recorded by radiosonde thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites he found a percent correlation over the year period of the study the overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within degrees celsius about fahrenheit per decade the same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions the idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement christy said if satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else the radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of degrees celsius about fahrenheit per decade since over those spots on the globe the satellites also recorded a warming trend degrees celsius about fahrenheit per decade globally however the satellite data show a cooling trend of degrees celsius per decade since the first noaa tirosn satellites went into service these radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet christy said they are not representative of the total globe radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world usually at noon and midnight greenwich standard time as each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio while there are more than radiosonde launch sites globally the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected christy used data from sites at which there has been longterm systematic and reliable data collection these radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by iceland trinidad truk island and alaska in an earlier study an upper air temperature record compiled by noaa from daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a year climate trend of c per decade which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time christy said global coverage one advantage of the msu dataset is its global coverage microwave sounding units aboard noaa satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than percent of the globe each satellite measures the temperature above most points on earth every hours the global temperature that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method it neglects vast oceanic and continental regions including antarctica the brazilian rain forests the sahara desert and greenland the most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from groundbased thermometers more than thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists most of these thermometers which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground are in areas easily accessible to people in the us and other industrial countries these thermometers are most often found at airports the groundbased network is extensive in north america europe russia china and japan it is less comprehensive in africa south america australia and across much of southern asia temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world usually at noon and midnight greenwich standard time while balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world they are concentrated in industrial nations there are more than radiosonde launch sites globally if they were evenly distributed around the world that would equal approximately one for every square miles of the earths surface water temperatures which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures come from thermometers on piers and buoys and aboard ships of opportunity the ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines the water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage tending instead to be concentrated in heavilytravelled shipping lanes and in harbors in the past years a new system of approximately deep ocean buoys has been established gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data instrument accuracy msu with nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years a method was devised to merge all the data into a single consistent time series each satellite has its own bias that if not calculated and removed would introduce spurious trends the biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years and were sufficient to determine these biases because the msu instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations the biases between the satellites are known to within deg the final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base to check the final product comparisons were made over a year period with balloon measurements as stated above and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate instrument accuracy groundbased thermometers of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings since most thermometers for which longterm records exist are in towns and cities the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads parking lots runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization this temperature change may be an artifact of a local asphalt effect rather than a longterm widespread climate change instrument accuracy ships of opportunity while the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature this data reflects water temperatures from about three to feet below the surface the level from which water is drawn into the ships the thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy the scientists in spencer and christy received the american meteorological societys special

interesting ive always wondered about things considered to be bad example the goto most languages support a goto of some sort so are gotos really bad oh goodie my final year project rears its head is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of programming syntax much as i would like to answer an unqualified yes i must admit if you already code in a style that makes heavy use of gotos coding in the same style with gosubs or function calls does not improve code much the same as when the manuals on modular coding said to write modules that would fit on a single sheet of computer paper lots of coders proceeded to split their code into arbitrary line chunks however goto considered harmful points out that to analyse debug code you need to be able to tell what the point of execution is and what the values of the variables are at that point this is an easytm job if the code uses assignment if for and functions but not if it uses goto see for the full letter despite being one of dijkstras braindamaged children who learned basic at an early age i never use goto anymore or any of its bastard offspring like break continue fudged function calls with sleight of hand in the variables my code is longer than it might be if i had used goto at a critical handy point however code is a bit like networks you always end up adding bits on where you didnt expect to and the benefit is felt when another person like myself but in three months time is modifying or debugging it and doesnt have to go through the hassle of dealing with the impact of the goto dave irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

did you want this on the list im replying to the list on sep at guido van rossum wrote whats an autoham automatically marking something as ham after a given timeout regardless of how long that timeout is someone is going to forget to submit the message back as spam how many spamsashams can be accepted before the fn rate gets unacceptable how about adding an imap server with a spam and deletedham folder most email clients can handle imap users should be able to quickly move spam into the spam folder i personally dont think imap has a bright future but for people who do use it thats certainly a good approach instead of deleting messages or by reprogramming the delete function they can quickly move ham into the ham folder yes i view imap as a stopgap measure until tighter integration with various email clients can be achieved i still feel its better to require classification feedback from the recipient rather than make any assumptions after some period of time passes but this is an enduser issue and were still at the algorithm stage brad clements bkcmurkworkscom fax aolim bkclements

evangelicals threat to new archbishop direct action threat over liberal views on sexuality stephen bates religious affairs correspondent tuesday october the guardian evangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust rowan williams the incoming archbishop of canterbury before he even takes up his post by threatening to take direct action against him the council of the church society the church of englands oldest evangelical body joined a younger evangelical pressure group called reform which is also opposed to dr williams in calling on him to recant his supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down following an emergency meeting the yearold society whose leaders met the archbishop last week proclaimed their continued opposition to his appointment and called on all anglicans to spurn him the move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to destabilise the new archbishop whose leftwing political views are regarded with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement some evangelicals object to dr williamss acknowledgement that he has ordained a gay priest something many bishops have done and that those who have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned the new archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the church nevertheless the society said it is clear that he prefers his private judgment to the voice of scripture to the voice of tradition and to the common mind of the church as such he can only be a focus of disunity the council called upon loyal anglicans to pray specifically that rowan williams would see the error in his teaching change his views or stand down it said the society claimed to have drawn up an action plan including calling on bishops and primates of the million worldwide anglican communion of which archbishops of canterbury are the leaders to distance themselves from dr williamss doctrinal and ethical position it promised it would be taking steps towards appropriate direct action it added that dr williams remained on the editorial board of a journal called theology and sexuality which six months ago published articles allegedly commending homosexual behaviour despite its claim the society does not represent the common mind of the church dr williams currently archbishop of wales was chosen by the crown appointments commission of church members including evangelicals and his appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the queen he is due to succeed george carey who retires this month and will be formally enthroned at canterbury cathedral in february asked what form direct action might take the rev george curry the societys chairman said watch this space presumably it could involve a small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where dr williams is present church of england bishops who have hitherto largely kept their heads down during the row are meeting next week to discuss their response to the evangelical extremists challenge which appears to have grown in the absence of a robust rebuttal a letter by senior theologians in todays guardian however repudiates the evangelicals tactics calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical teaching on the bbcs thought for the day yesterday angela tilby viceprincipal of westcott house cambridge accused dr williamss opponents of presumption and blackmail it is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave it is attempting to force an issue by emotional violence manipulating to get your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation she said last week dr williams said he was deeply saddened matters of sexuality should not have the priority or centrality that reform and the church society have tried to give them the archbishop can not withdraw his appointment since so many including evangelicals have urged him to take the post the archbishop believes it to be his duty under god yahoo groups sponsor sell a home with ease to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteanaunsubscribeegroupscom your use of yahoo groups is subject to

so then tim peters timonecomcastnet is all like im not sure what youre doing but suspect youre storing individual wordinfo pickles if so most of the administrative pickle bloat is due to that and doesnt happen if you pickle an entire classifier instance directly yeah thats exactly what i was doingi didnt realize i was incurring administrative pickle bloat this way im specifically trying to make things faster and smaller so im storing individual wordinfo pickles into an anydbm dict keyed by token the result is that its almost times faster to score messages one per run our of procmail s vs s however it does say all over the place that the goal of this project isnt to make the fastest or the smallest implementation so i guess ill hold off doing any further performance tuning until the goal starts to point more in that direction seconds is probably fast enough for people to use it in their procmailrc which is what i was after if youre desparate to save memory write a subclass thats probably what ill do if i get too antsy trying to think of ways to sneak administrative pickle boat into casual conversation neale

david asked my wife noticed something odd the nearlyfull moon was about degrees above the horizon there was a notable glow on the horizon except under the moon the moon seemed to be in a column of darkness that was about three times the apparent width of the moon we could see the column over its entire length as a strip of sky darker than the sky around it any of you ever see this do you have any idea what could have caused it i suspect its due to some pecularity of the visual system but have no clear idea im surprised to not find this phenomenon in corlis i could have sworn i saw it there he does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow and a secondary bow i personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a semicircle of darker sky i know ive read about pillars under the sun and moon elsewhere but i cant recall if they were reportedly dark or bright i do know these sorts of things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system im sorry i havent got any answers but a search through some books on atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up bill william jacobs freelance unemployed person yahoo groups sponsor dvds free sp join now to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteanaunsubscribeegroupscom your use of yahoo groups is subject to

free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty im not a sociopoliticalhistory buff does anybody have some clear examples original message from rohit khare kharealumnicaltechedu to forkspamassassintaintorg sent friday september pm subject sed sunited statesroman empireg a world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than a day is neither just nor stable absolutely correct perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about life on earth today the following is a fascinating document of official government policy that bears close reading it is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in an imperfect world the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel i was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of radio sawa our new musicandnews channel for year old arabs its in practically every market its entered nearing listenership in amman and its even beginning to be trusted for news well past bbc and taking share from every other government broadcaster it is as hard to imagine america losing a war of ideas in the longterm as it is to imagine america making any headway at all in the short term many of you may disagree but i found the document below surprisingly centrist if you know the code you can hear clearly partisan tones re icc taiwan relations act etc but still this is as much a democratic platform as not africa and aids take up more mindshare than i feared they might as you read replace united states with roman empire and it may make as much sense in the long view of history i dont know how proud to be about that but it is telling sometime i daydream that the president might sit down with the nation with perotista flip charts and explain to our citizens the sheer vastness of our military installations overseas and what they do for us it would be a powerful education on how engaged we are in the world around us heck id love to see a realtime map of federal expenditures around the globe a softly glowing necklace of embassies carriers arctic research stations hotels golf courses warehouses libraries clinics and all the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy of course this still doesnt leave me any more comfortable with the real news in this document the bush doctrine for preemptive strikes id sooner repeal the church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world rohit september full text bushs national security strategy following is the full text of president bushs new national security strategy the document entitled the national security strategy of the united states will soon be transmitted to congress as a declaration of the administrations policy introduction the great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom and a single sustainable model for national success freedom democracy and free enterprise in the twentyfirst century only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity people everywhere want to say what they think choose who will govern them worship as they please educate their children male and female own property and enjoy the benefits of their labor these values of freedom are right and true for every person in every society and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedomloving people across the globe and across the ages today the united states enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence in keeping with our heritage and principles we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage we seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty by making the world safer we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better we will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent defending our nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the federal government today that task has changed dramatically enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger america now shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us to defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing the war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration america will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror and america will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization the united states and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases together we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn the gravest danger our nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination the united states will not allow these efforts to succeed we will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery we will cooperate with other nations to deny contain and curtail our enemies efforts to acquire dangerous technologies and as a matter of common sense and selfdefense america will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed we can not defend america and our friends by hoping for the best so we must be prepared to defeat our enemies plans using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation history will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act in the new world we have entered the only path to safety is the path of action as we defend the peace we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace today the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nationstate in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war today the worlds great powers find ourselves on the same side united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos the united states will build on these common interests to promote global security we are also increasingly united by common values russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth in time they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness america will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order we will strongly resist aggression from other great powers even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity trade and cultural advancement finally the united states will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe we will actively work to bring the hope of democracy development free markets and free trade to every corner of the world the events of september taught us that weak states like afghanistan can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers yet poverty weak institutions and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders the united states will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty so the united states will work with individual nations entire regions and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity the united states will deliver greater development assistance through the new millennium challenge account to nations that govern justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom we will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of aids and other infectious diseases in building a balance of power that favors freedom the united states is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely so that aid is well spent for freedom to thrive accountability must be expected and required we are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer better world alone alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedomloving nations the united states is committed to lasting institutions like the united nations the world trade organization the organization of american states and nato as well as other longstanding alliances coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions in all cases international obligations are to be taken seriously they are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment freedom is the nonnegotiable demand of human dignity the birthright of every person in every civilization throughout history freedom has been threatened by war and terror it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease today humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedoms triumph over all these foes the united states welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission i overview of americas international strategy our nations cause has always been larger than our nations defense we fight as we always fight for a just peace a peace that favors liberty we will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers and we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent president bush west point new york june the united states possesses unprecedented and unequaled strength and influence in the world sustained by faith in the principles of liberty and the value of a free society this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities obligations and opportunity the great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom for most of the twentieth century the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality that great struggle is over the militant visions of class nation and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited america is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones we are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few we must defeat these threats to our nation allies and friends this is also a time of opportunity for america we will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace prosperity and liberty the us national security strategy will be based on a distinctly american internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests the aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better our goals on the path to progress are clear political and economic freedom peaceful relations with other states and respect for human dignity and this path is not americas alone it is open to all to achieve these goals the united states will champion aspirations for human dignity strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends work with others to defuse regional conflicts prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power and transform americas national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twentyfirst century ii champion aspirations for human dignity some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong i disagree different circumstances require different methods but not different moralities president bush west point new york june in pursuit of our goals our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for the united states must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere no nation owns these aspirations and no nation is exempt from them fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence no people on earth yearn to be oppressed aspire to servitude or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police america must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity the rule of law limits on the absolute power of the state free speech freedom of worship equal justice respect for women religious and ethnic tolerance and respect for private property these demands can be met in many ways americas constitution has served us well many other nations with different histories and cultures facing different circumstances have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance history has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals but even in our worst moments the principles enshrined in the declaration of independence were there to guide us as a result america is not just a stronger but is a freer and more just society today these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty and when openings arrive we can encourage change as we did in central and eastern europe between and or in belgrade in when we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in taiwan or in the republic of korea and see elected leaders replace generals in latin america and africa we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today the national security strategy of the united states must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty our principles will guide our governments decisions about international cooperation the character of our foreign assistance and the allocation of resources they will guide our actions and our words in international bodies we will speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle nonviolently for it ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future and take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments we will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it iii strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends just three days removed from these events americans do not yet have the distance of history but our responsibility to history is already clear to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil war has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder this nation is peaceful but fierce when stirred to anger the conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing president bush washington dc the national cathedral september the united states of america is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach the enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology the enemy is terrorism premeditated politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents in many regions legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace such grievances deserve to be and must be addressed within a political process but no cause justifies terror the united states will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them we make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them the struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history it will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes some seen some unseen today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can and will do against regimes that harbor support and use terrorism to achieve their political goals afghanistan has been liberated coalition forces continue to hunt down the taliban and alqaida but it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in north america south america europe africa the middle east and across asia our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership command control and communications material support and finances this will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists ability to plan and operate we will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state we will help ensure the state has the military law enforcement political and financial tools necessary to finish the task the united states will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism we will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them deny terrorists access to the international financial system protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists and prevent the movement of terrorists assets through alternative financial networks however this campaign need not be sequential to be effective the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek we will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction wmd or their precursors defending the united states the american people and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders while the united states will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community we will not hesitate to act alone if necessary to exercise our right of selfdefense by acting preemptively against such terrorists to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country and denying further sponsorship support and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities we will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism this includes using the full influence of the united states and working closely with allies and friends to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery piracy or genocide behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose supporting moderate and modern government especially in the muslim world to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk and using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism while we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening americas homeland security to protect against and deter attack this administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the truman administration created the national security council and the department of defense centered on a new department of homeland security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the fbi our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector this strategy will turn adversity into opportunity for example emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror but all infectious diseases and masscasualty dangers our border controls will not just stop terrorists but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic while our focus is protecting america we know that to defeat terrorism in todays globalized world we need support from our allies and friends wherever possible the united states will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide as we pursue the terrorists in afghanistan we will continue to work with international organizations such as the united nations as well as nongovernmental organizations and other countries to provide the humanitarian political economic and security assistance necessary to rebuild afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people threaten its neighbors and provide a haven for terrorists in the war against global terrorism we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life freedom and fear are at war and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict in leading the campaign against terrorism we are forging new productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twentyfirst century iv work with others to defuse regional conflicts we build a world of justice or we will live in a world of coercion the magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small president bush berlin germany may concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering in an increasingly interconnected world regional crisis can strain our alliances rekindle rivalries among the major powers and create horrifying affronts to human dignity when violence erupts and states falter the united states will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability no doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which us action direct or indirect is warranted we have finite political economic and military resources to meet our global priorities the united states will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind the united states should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge the united states should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves where and when people are ready to do their part we will be willing to move decisively policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles the israelipalestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering because of americas close relationship with the state of israel and key arab states and because of that regions importance to other global priorities of the united states there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides america stands committed to an independent and democratic palestine living beside israel in peace and security like all other people palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests and listens to their voices and counts their votes the united states will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict the united states the international donor community and the world bank stand ready to work with a reformed palestinian government on economic development increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish finance and monitor a truly independent judiciary if palestinians embrace democracy and the rule of law confront corruption and firmly reject terror they can count on american support for the creation of a palestinian state israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic palestine permanent occupation threatens israels identity and democracy so the united states continues to challenge israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable credible palestinian state as there is progress towards security israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to september and consistent with the recommendations of the mitchell committee israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop as violence subsides freedom of movement should be restored permitting innocent palestinians to resume work and normal life the united states can play a crucial role but ultimately lasting peace can only come when israelis and palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them in south asia the united states has also emphasized the need for india and pakistan to resolve their disputes this administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with india and pakistan these strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute with pakistan our bilateral relations have been bolstered by pakistans choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society the administration sees indias potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twentyfirst century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly our involvement in this regional dispute building on earlier investments in bilateral relations looks first to concrete steps by india and pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law by tolerating ethnic minorities respecting the rule of law and accepting open markets indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation it is the initiative by indonesia that allows us assistance to make a difference in the western hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities particularly mexico brazil canada chile and colombia together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security prosperity opportunity and hope we will work with regional institutions such as the summit of the americas process the organization of american states oas and the defense ministerial of the americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere parts of latin america confront regional conflict especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices this conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the united states therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the andean nations adjust their economies enforce their laws defeat terrorist organizations and cut off the supply of drugs while as important we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country in colombia we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups we are working to help colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the colombian people in africa promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease war and desperate poverty this threatens both a core value of the united states preserving human dignity and our strategic priority combating global terror american interests and american principles therefore lead in the same direction we will work with others for an african continent that lives in liberty peace and growing prosperity together with our european allies we must help strengthen africas fragile states help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists an ever more lethal environment exists in africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats africas great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement and builds coalitions of the willing this administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as south africa nigeria kenya and ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention coordination with european allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations and africas capable reforming states and subregional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in subsaharan africa where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference the transition to the african union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent v prevent our enemies from threatening us our allies and our friends with weapons of mass destruction the gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology when the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons along with ballistic missile technology when that occurs even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations our enemies have declared this very intention and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons they want the capability to blackmail us or to harm us or to harm our friends and we will oppose them with all our power president bush west point new york june the nature of the cold war threat required the united states with our allies and friends to emphasize deterrence of the enemys use of force producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction with the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war our security environment has undergone profound transformation having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our relationship with russia the dividends are evident an end to the balance of terror that divided us an historic reduction in the nuclear arsenals on both sides and cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were inconceivable but new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists none of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power that was arrayed against us by the soviet union however the nature and motivations of these new adversaries their determination to obtain destructive powers hitherto available only to the worlds strongest states and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass destruction against us make todays security environment more complex and dangerous in the s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue states that while different in important ways share a number of attributes these states brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers display no regard for international law threaten their neighbors and callously violate international treaties to which they are party are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction along with other advanced military technology to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes sponsor terrorism around the globe and reject basic human values and hate the united states and everything for which it stands at the time of the gulf war we acquired irrefutable proof that iraqs designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against iran and its own people but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biological agents in the past decade north korea has become the worlds principal purveyor of ballistic missiles and has tested increasingly capable missiles while developing its own wmd arsenal other rogue regimes seek nuclear biological and chemical weapons as well these states pursuit of and global trade in such weapons has become a looming threat to all nations we must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the united states and our allies and friends our response must take full advantage of strengthened alliances the establishment of new partnerships with former adversaries innovation in the use of military forces modern technologies including the development of an effective missile defense system and increased emphasis on intelligence collection and analysis our comprehensive strategy to combat wmd includes proactive counterproliferation efforts we must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed we must ensure that key capabilities detection active and passive defenses and counterforce capabilities are integrated into our defense transformation and our homeland security systems counterproliferation must also be integrated into the doctrine training and equipping of our forces and those of our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with wmdarmed adversaries strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction we will enhance diplomacy arms control multilateral export controls and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking wmd and when necessary interdict enabling technologies and materials we will continue to build coalitions to support these efforts encouraging their increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs the recent g agreement to commit up to billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step forward effective consequence management to respond to the effects of wmd use whether by terrorists or hostile states minimizing the effects of wmd use against our people will help deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they can not attain their desired ends the united states must also be prepared to respond to the effects of wmd use against our forces abroad and to help friends and allies if they are attacked it has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of this new threat given the goals of rogue states and terrorists the united states can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past the inability to deter a potential attacker the immediacy of todays threats and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries choice of weapons do not permit that option we can not let our enemies strike first in the cold war especially following the cuban missile crisis we faced a generally status quo riskaverse adversary deterrence was an effective defense but deterrence based only upon the threat of retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willing to take risks gambling with the lives of their people and the wealth of their nations in the cold war weapons of mass destruction were considered weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who used them today our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons of choice for rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and military aggression against their neighbors these weapons may also allow these states to attempt to blackmail the united states and our allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior of rogue states such states also see these weapons as their best means of overcoming the conventional superiority of the united states traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of innocents whose socalled soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most potent protection is statelessness the overlap between states that sponsor terror and those that pursue wmd compels us to action for centuries international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the existence of an imminent threat most often a visible mobilization of armies navies and air forces preparing to attack we must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of todays adversaries rogue states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using conventional means they know such attacks would fail instead they rely on acts of terrorism and potentially the use of weapons of mass destruction weapons that can be easily concealed and delivered covertly and without warning the targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian population in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law of warfare as was demonstrated by the losses on september mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction the united states has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security the greater the threat the greater is the risk of inaction and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemys attack to forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries the united states will if necessary act preemptively the united states will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging threats nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the worlds most destructive technologies the united states can not remain idle while dangers gather we will always proceed deliberately weighing the consequences of our actions to support preemptive options we will build better more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide timely accurate information on threats wherever they may emerge coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the most dangerous threats and continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results the purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat to the united states or our allies and friends the reasons for our actions will be clear the force measured and the cause just vi ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade when nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few no amount no amount of development aid is ever enough when nations respect their people open markets invest in better health and education every dollar of aid every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively president bush monterrey mexico march a strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes it allows people to lift their lives out of poverty spurs economic and legal reform and the fight against corruption and it reinforces the habits of liberty we will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond americas shores all governments are responsible for creating their own economic policies and responding to their own economic challenge we will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth including progrowth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment innovation and entrepreneurial activity tax policies particularly lower marginal tax rates that improve incentives for work and investment rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most efficient use sound fiscal policies to support business activity investments in health and education that improve the wellbeing and skills of the labor force and population as a whole and free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and opportunity the lessons of history are clear market economies not commandandcontrol economies with the heavy hand of government are the best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty policies that further strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for all economies industrialized countries emerging markets and the developing world a return to strong economic growth in europe and japan is vital to us national security interests we want our allies to have strong economies for their own sake for the sake of the global economy and for the sake of global security european efforts to remove structural barriers in their economies are particularly important in this regard as are japans efforts to end deflation and address the problems of nonperforming loans in the japanese banking system we will continue to use our regular consultations with japan and our european partners including through the group of seven g to discuss policies they are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher global economic growth improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic growth international flows of investment capital are needed to expand the productive potential of these economies these flows allow emerging markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise living standards and reduce poverty our longterm objective should be a world in which all countries have investmentgrade credit ratings that allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in their future we are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve access to larger capital flows at lower cost to this end we will continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial markets we will work actively with other countries the international monetary fund imf and the private sector to implement the g action plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and more effectively resolving them when they occur the best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from occurring and we have encouraged the imf to improve its efforts doing so we will continue to work with the imf to streamline the policy conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy exchange rate policy and financial sector policy the concept of free trade arose as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of economics if you can make something that others value you should be able to sell it to them if others make something that you value you should be able to buy it this is real freedom the freedom for a person or a nation to make a living to promote free trade the unites states has developed a comprehensive strategy seize the global initiative the new global trade negotiations we helped launch at doha in november will have an ambitious agenda especially in agriculture manufacturing and services targeted for completion in the united states has led the way in completing the accession of china and a democratic taiwan to the world trade organization we will assist russias preparations to join the wto press regional initiatives the united states and other democracies in the western hemisphere have agreed to create the free trade area of the americas targeted for completion in this year the united states will advocate marketaccess negotiations with its partners targeted on agriculture industrial goods services investment and government procurement we will also offer more opportunity to the poorest continent africa starting with full use of the preferences allowed in the african growth and opportunity act and leading to free trade move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements building on the free trade agreement with jordan enacted in the administration will work this year to complete free trade agreements with chile and singapore our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of developed and developing countries in all regions of the world initially central america southern africa morocco and australia will be our principal focal points renew the executivecongressional partnership every administrations trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with congress after a gap of years the administration reestablished majority support in the congress for trade liberalization by passing trade promotion authority and the other market opening measures for developing countries in the trade act of this administration will work with congress to enact new bilateral regional and global trade agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed trade promotion authority promote the connection between trade and development trade policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights competition the rule of law investment the spread of knowledge open societies the efficient allocation of resources and regional integration all leading to growth opportunity and confidence in developing countries the united states is implementing the africa growth and opportunity act to provide marketaccess for nearly all goods produced in the countries of subsaharan africa we will make more use of this act and its equivalent for the caribbean basin and continue to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer countries take advantage of these opportunities beyond market access the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health we will ensure that the wto intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like hivaids tuberculosis and malaria enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices commerce depends on the rule of law international trade depends on enforceable agreements our top priorities are to resolve ongoing disputes with the european union canada and mexico and to make a global effort to address new technology science and health regulations that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture laws against unfair trade practices are often abused but the international community must be able to address genuine concerns about government subsidies and dumping international industrial espionage which undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred help domestic industries and workers adjust there is a sound statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the american steel industry the benefits of free trade depend upon the enforcement of fair trading practices these safeguards help ensure that the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of american workers trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the change and dynamism of open markets protect the environment and workers the united states must foster economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with widening prosperity we will incorporate labor and environmental concerns into us trade negotiations creating a healthy network between multilateral environmental agreements with the wto and use the international labor organization trade preference programs and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade enhance energy security we will strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our allies trading partners and energy producers to expand the sources and types of global energy supplied especially in the western hemisphere africa central asia and the caspian region we will also continue to work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient technologies economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth containing them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the global climate our overall objective is to reduce americas greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy cutting such emissions per unit of economic activity by percent over the next years by the year our strategies for attaining this goal will be to remain committed to the basic un framework convention for international cooperation obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to companies that can show real cuts develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission reductions promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology as well as nuclear power which produces no greenhouse gas emissions while also improving fuel economy for us cars and trucks increase spending on research and new conservation technologies to a total of billion the largest sum being spent on climate change by any country in the world and a million increase over last years budget and assist developing countries especially the major greenhouse gas emitters such as china and india so that they will have the tools and resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and better path vii expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy in world war ii we fought to make the world safer then worked to rebuild it as we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens president bush washington dc interamerican development bank march a world where some live in comfort and plenty while half of the human race lives on less than a day is neither just nor stable including all of the worlds poor in an expanding circle of development and opportunity is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of us international policy decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries worse development aid has often served to prop up failed policies relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients these are the indicators of a failed strategy working with other nations the united states is confronting this failure we forged a new consensus at the un conference on financing for development in monterrey that the objectives of assistance and the strategies to achieve those objectives must change this administrations goal is to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without the right national policies where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance the united states and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target to double the size of the worlds poorest economies within a decade the united states government will pursue these major strategies to achieve this goal provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform we propose a percent increase in the core development assistance given by the united states while continuing our present programs including humanitarian assistance based on need alone these billions of new dollars will form a new millennium challenge account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly invest in their people and encourage economic freedom governments must fight corruption respect basic human rights embrace the rule of law invest in health care and education follow responsible economic policies and enable entrepreneurship the millennium challenge account will reward countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those that have not to implement reforms improve the effectiveness of the world bank and other development banks in raising living standards the united states is committed to a comprehensive reform agenda for making the world bank and the other multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of the worlds poor we have reversed the downward trend in us contributions and proposed an percent increase in the us contributions to the international development association ida the world banks fund for the poorest countries and the african development fund the key to raising living standards and reducing poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth especially in the poorest countries we will continue to press the multilateral development banks to focus on activities that increase economic productivity such as improvements in education health rule of law and private sector development every project every loan every grant must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in developing countries insist upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the worlds poor when it comes to economic development what really matters is that more children are getting a better education more people have access to health care and clean water or more workers can find jobs to make a better future for their families we have a moral obligation to measure the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering results for this reason we will continue to demand that our own development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for achieving those goals thanks to us leadership the recent ida replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation system that measures recipient countries progress for the first time donors can link a portion of their contributions to ida to the achievement of actual development results and part of the us contribution is linked in this way we will strive to make sure that the world bank and other multilateral development banks build on this progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything that these institutions do increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans greater use of resultsbased grants is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments particularly in the social sectors without saddling them with everlarger debt burdens as a result of us leadership the recent ida agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the poorest countries for education hivaids health nutrition water sanitation and other human needs our goal is to build on that progress by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development banks we will also challenge universities nonprofits and the private sector to match government efforts by using grants to support development projects that show results open societies to commerce and investment trade and investment are the real engines of economic growth even if government aid increases most money for development must come from trade domestic capital and foreign investment an effective strategy must try to expand these flows as well free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national security strategy secure public health the scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is enormous in countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like hivaids malaria and tuberculosis growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be contained resources from the developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest governance which supports prevention programs and provides effective local infrastructure the united states has strongly backed the new global fund for hivaids organized by un secretary general kofi annan and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for treatment and care the united states already contributes more than twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor if the global fund demonstrates its promise we will be ready to give even more emphasize education literacy and learning are the foundation of democracy and development only about percent of world bank resources are devoted to education this proportion should grow the united states will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher training in africa the united states can also bring information technology to these societies many of whose education systems have been devastated by aids continue to aid agricultural development new technologies including biotechnology have enormous potential to improve crop yields in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water using sound science the united states should help bring these benefits to the million people including million children who still suffer from hunger and malnutrition viii develop agendas for cooperative action with the other main centers of global power we have our best chance since the rise of the nationstate in the th century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war president bush west point new york june america will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions as broad as practicable of states able and willing to promote a balance of power that favors freedom effective coalition leadership requires clear priorities an appreciation of others interests and consistent consultations among partners with a spirit of humility there is little of lasting consequence that the united states can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in canada and europe europe is also the seat of two of the strongest and most able international institutions in the world the north atlantic treaty organization nato which has since its inception been the fulcrum of transatlantic and intereuropean security and the european union eu our partner in opening world trade the attacks of september were also an attack on nato as nato itself recognized when it invoked its article v selfdefense clause for the first time natos core mission collective defense of the transatlantic alliance of democracies remains but nato must develop new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new circumstances nato must build a capability to field at short notice highly mobile specially trained forces whenever they are needed to respond to a threat against any member of the alliance the alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened creating coalitions under natos own mandate as well as contributing to missionbased coalitions to achieve this we must expand natos membership to those democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests ensure that the military forces of nato nations have appropriate combat contributions to make in coalition warfare develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become effective multinational fighting forces take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of scale in our defense spending to transform nato military forces so that they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of training integrating and experimenting with new force configurations and maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces if nato succeeds in enacting these changes the rewards will be a partnership as central to the security and interests of its member states as was the case during the cold war we will sustain a common perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to take common action in defense of our nations and their interests at the same time we welcome our european allies efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and defense identity with the eu and commit ourselves to close consultations to ensure that these developments work with nato we can not afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come the attacks of september energized americas asian alliances australia invoked the anzus treaty to declare the september was an attack on australia itself following that historic decision with the dispatch of some of the worlds finest combat forces for operation enduring freedom japan and the republic of korea provided unprecedented levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist attack we have deepened cooperation on counterterrorism with our alliance partners in thailand and the philippines and received invaluable assistance from close friends like singapore and new zealand the war against terrorism has proven that americas alliances in asia not only underpin regional peace and stability but are flexible and ready to deal with new challenges to enhance our asian alliances and friendships we will look to japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and global affairs based on our common interests our common values and our close defense and diplomatic cooperation work with south korea to maintain vigilance towards the north while preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of the region over the longerterm build on years of usaustralian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional and global problems as we have so many times from the battle of leyte gulf to tora bora maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies our requirements our technological advances and the strategic environment and build on stability provided by these alliances as well as with institutions such as asean and the asiapacific economic cooperation forum to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region we are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition most importantly russia india and china in all three cases recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape with russia we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twentyfirst century the united states and russia are no longer strategic adversaries the moscow treaty on strategic reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in russian thinking that promises to lead to productive longterm relations with the euroatlantic community and the united states russias top leaders have a realistic assessment of their countrys current weakness and the policies internal and external needed to reverse those weaknesses they understand increasingly that cold war approaches do not serve their national interests and that russian and american strategic interests overlap in many areas united states policy seeks to use this turn in russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges we are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism we are facilitating russias entry into the world trade organization without lowering standards for accession to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations we have created the natorussia council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among russia our european allies and ourselves we will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former soviet union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce russias growing commitment to integration into the euroatlantic community at the same time we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key russian elites slows improvement in our relations russias uneven commitment to the basic values of freemarket democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern russias very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation nevertheless those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years or even decades the united states has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with india based on a conviction that us interests require a strong relationship with india we are the two largest democracies committed to political freedom protected by representative government india is moving toward greater economic freedom as well we have a common interest in the free flow of commerce including through the vital sea lanes of the indian ocean finally we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable asia differences remain including over the development of indias nuclear and missile programs and the pace of indias economic reforms but while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about india today we start with a view of india as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests through a strong partnership with india we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future the united states relationship with china is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable peaceful and prosperous asiapacific region we welcome the emergence of a strong peaceful and prosperous china the democratic development of china is crucial to that future yet a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the communist legacy chinas leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the asiapacific region china is following an outdated path that in the end will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness in time china will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness the united states seeks a constructive relationship with a changing china we already cooperate well where our interests overlap including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the korean peninsula likewise we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counterterrorism and similar transitional concerns shared health and environmental threats such as the spread of hivaids challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become more open with information promote the development of civil society and enhance individual human rights china has begun to take the road to political openness permitting many personal freedoms and conducting villagelevel elections yet remains strongly committed to national oneparty rule by the communist party to make that nation truly accountable to its citizens needs and aspirations however much work remains to be done only by allowing the chinese people to think assemble and worship freely can china reach its full potential our important trade relationship will benefit from chinas entry into the world trade organization which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for american farmers workers and companies china is our fourth largest trading partner with over billion in annual twoway trade the power of market principles and the wtos requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in china to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens there are however other areas in which we have profound disagreements our commitment to the selfdefense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act is one human rights is another we expect china to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments we will work to narrow differences where they exist but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree the events of september fundamentally changed the context for relations between the united states and other main centers of global power and opened vast new opportunities with our longstanding allies in europe and asia and with leaders in russia india and china we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive every agency of the united states government shares the challenge we can build fruitful habits of consultation quiet argument sober analysis and common action in the longterm these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress ix transform americas national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twentyfirst century terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity they did not touch its source america is successful because of the hard work creativity and enterprise of our people president bush washington dc joint session of congress september the major institutions of american national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements all of them must be transformed it is time to reaffirm the essential role of american military strength we must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge our militarys highest priority is to defend the united states to do so effectively our military must assure our allies and friends dissuade future military competition deter threats against us interests allies and friends and decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails the unparalleled strength of the united states armed forces and their forward presence have maintained the peace in some of the worlds most strategically vital regions however the threats and enemies we must confront have changed and so must our forces a military structured to deter massive cold warera armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur we will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges the presence of american forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the us commitments to allies and friends through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others the united states demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom to contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face the united states will require bases and stations within and beyond western europe and northeast asia as well as temporary access arrangements for the longdistance deployment of us forces before the war in afghanistan that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies yet in a very short time we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation using every branch of the armed forces we must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing longrange precision strike capabilities and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces this broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland conduct information operations ensure us access to distant theaters and protect critical us infrastructure and assets in outer space innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare strengthening joint operations exploiting us intelligence advantages and taking full advantage of science and technology we must also transform the way the department of defense is run especially in financial management and recruitment and retention finally while maintaining nearterm readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism the goal must be to provide the president with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the united states our allies and our friends we know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from experience that some enemies can not be deterred the united states must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy whether a state or nonstate actor to impose its will on the united states our allies or our friends we will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations and to defend freedom our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military buildup in hopes of surpassing or equaling the power of the united states intelligence and how we use it is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive fixed object the soviet bloc the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets we must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends we need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury we must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the united states we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement initiatives in this area will include strengthening the authority of the director of central intelligence to lead the development and actions of the nations foreign intelligence capabilities establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities and collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with allsource analysis as the united states government relies on the armed forces to defend americas interests it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations we will ensure that the department of state receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of american diplomacy the state department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments and in this new era its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with nongovernmental organizations and international institutions officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world including public health education law enforcement the judiciary and public diplomacy our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations civil wars and other humanitarian catastrophes as humanitarian relief requirements are better understood we must also be able to help build police forces court systems and legal codes local and provincial government institutions and electoral systems effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals backed by american readiness to play our part just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand america the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations it does however reveal the clash inside a civilization a battle for the future of the muslim world this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel we will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations inquiry or prosecution by the international criminal court icc whose jurisdiction does not extend to americans and which we do not accept we will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect us nationals from the icc we will implement fully the american servicemembers protection act whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of us personnel and officials we will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security the united states government must strengthen its defenses to win this war at home our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the american people today the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing in a globalized world events beyond americas borders have a greater impact inside them our society must be open to people ideas and goods from across the globe the characteristics we most cherish our freedom our cities our systems of movement and modern life are vulnerable to terrorism this vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the september eleventh attacks as time passes individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies fleets and squadrons this is a new condition of life we will adjust to it and thrive in spite of it in exercising our leadership we will respect the values judgment and interests of our friends and partners still we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require when we disagree on particulars we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives we will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together with our allies and our friends our shared fundamental interests and values ultimately the foundation of american strength is at home it is in the skills of our people the dynamism of our economy and the resilience of our institutions a diverse modern society has inherent ambitious entrepreneurial energy our strength comes from what we do with that

from there has mostly been talk thus far and little action but the department of justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against individuals who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted material over the internet deputy assistant attorney general john malcolm believes that criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to preserve the viability of americas content industries malcolm also believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are participating in a legal activity i certainly think people who download copyrighted works understand that such distributionbarring provisions such as fair useis not authorized and it is not surprising to see businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of copyrighted works some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpfuli think they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal prosecution said riaa president cary sherman who was on the same conference panel im not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect sherman is hoping for although infrequent there have already been civil suits or warnings issued to private individuals and they have served as minor deterrents to the filesharing community at large criminal lawsuits carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate further animosity against groups such as the riaa and may be difficult to initiate because of the schooling effect of millions of systems participating in file sharing only servers would seem to stand out from the crowd the article cites the no electronic theft net act which defines illegal activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement criminal infringement any person who infringes a copyright willfully for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain or by the reproduction or distribution including by electronic means during any day period of or more copies or phonorecords of or more copyrighted works which have a total retail value of more than for purposes of this subsection evidence of reproduction or distribution of a copyrighted work by itself shall not be sufficient to establish willful infringement the term financial gain includes receipt or expectation of receipt of anything of value including the receipt of other copyrighted works therefore receipt of a work of value would be defined as financial gain even if no money is involved the net act excerpt does not clarify how the value of a work is determined an album or movie could be worth only to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the perspective of the consumer or copyright holder the statute of limitations limitations on actions a criminal proceedingsno criminal proceeding shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five years after the cause of action arose b civil actionsno civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued the penalties are too extensive to list here but they can be found in section criminal infringement of a copyright in general firsttime criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of year im still not sure where the doj would start in choosing people to prosecute because of the aforementioned schooling effect but my guess would be that just like speeding primarily the most prominent individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers thanks to monalisaoverdrive for pointing out this story

url date not supplied ive been snowed under for the last four weeks working on the fogbugz setup program for various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits wise installshield windows installer could do even of what our setup program needed to do so i ended up writing it from scratch vc and mfc all the way it took longer than i expected because i had this weird conviction that the entire setup process should be completely reversable and as you go backwards through the wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already made so even if youre looking at the last screen if you decide you want to change where to extract the files you can just back up and change it and everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted are ungranted and the sql database you made is unmade and so on the end result is a great setup program but it may be a tad overkill if i have time ill write more about what i learned one benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that i dont have to have someone elses stupid cartoonofacomputerandfloppydisks in the upper right hand corner i used a photograph of the london skyline currently infested with cranes i took the picture from the cafe at the tate modern img fogbugz setup

from stephen d williams mailtosdwlignet sent monday september pm which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters a which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its past certainly not christianity islam etc hence the qualifier current b how it is currently being expressed amounts to a tacit acknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and peoples selflimiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive expression this leads to the point that religion and less sophisticated societies are a dangerous mix it also tends to invoke the image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of society the tacit acknowledgement and selflimiting you speak of is not a given or a function of sophistication but is primarily a feature of current western civilization of course sophisticated and western civilization are essentially equivalent imho but it need not be so d the northern ireland protestant vs catholic feud recently more or less concluded is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated by splitting society too much along religious lines one post article pointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical integration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools government political party etc of course both cases have a heritage of british conquest but who doesnt and sometimes the religious component is a façade for an equally dangerous ethnic affiliation hindu extremism isnt about the hindu religious theology as far as i can see it is a peg to hang an ethnic identity and identity politics on muslim extremism appears to have a far greater connection to theology northern ireland is a british province of green valleys and cloudcovered hills whose million people are politically and religiously divided about percent of the population is protestant and most protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part of britain the roman catholic minority is predominantly republican or nationalist they want to merge with the republic of ireland to the south yep all because the scots ate oats and starved their irish out long ago while the english preferred wheat and that doesnt grow so well in ireland that and the introduction of potatoes saved the irish as irish thats fine as it would be an inappropriate concentration it would be difficult to address the issues raised here in a clean way id be happy with an acknowledgement that the connection is there oh i think we are in a war with wide aspects of the muslim religion i know it is there but it just might not be appropriate to admit it publicly us leadership remains reflexively multicultural this is ok to a point as long as it doesnt shy away from logical objective analysis of when a society could be seriously improved in certain ways i didnt say this was a good thing with the exception of ethnic restaurants i can generally be counted on to oppose anything labeled multicultural i didnt say burning the train was a good thing i said i understood it wasnt a spontaneous attack on people who had done no wrong true although i dont think you were as clear originally im sure i wasnt

hello justin the simplest setup would be to connect a wireless access point to you hub then use a wireless pcmcia network card in your laptop you could also get some pcmcia to pci adapters or wireless pci network cards for your desktop machines the access point would be configured with a network name essid and a channel number for you wireless network the client machine would be configured with the same network name it should be able to auto detect the channel number driver support is very good there are only a few wireless chipsets and i believe that all but the newest b plus mbps and a hardware has linux drivers if you need anymore help or info checkout the forums and irc channel at url robert fitzsimons robfitzknet on fri aug at pm justin maccarthy wrote i have a small network at home connected by port hub smoothwall smoothwall server shaftoe windows gotodengo linux the family has a new pc i want to plug in to use the isdn in smoothwall i also have a notebook i want to plug both of these into the network using a wireless connection whats the best way to do this i need to plug a wireless hub into my port hub right what wireless hardware is good for both linux windows im know very little about wireless thanks justin irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

on thu aug at am wintermute mentioned interesting ive always wondered about things considered to be bad example the goto most languages support a goto of some sort so are gotos really bad yes especially in the languages he was talking about c pascal and assembler gotos can be used well there are a few used in the kernel code to improve efficency they are almost required in some languages like c where break or continue cant be told how many loopsswitches to break out of but in general gotos make a mess of code is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of programming syntax to make sure people use loops or recursion to iterate is human to recurse divine recursion is only truely useful if you have an infinite stack people that think they have an infinite stack shouldnt be let near a compiler kind of makes you wonder about things considered to be good for example people bang on about polymorphism but is there actually any advantage in using an overloaded function based on class inheritance i dont care to be honest kate irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

on wed aug oates isaac wrote im new to razor but have studied trust systems before ive been following the threads about tes and have a few thoughts first a more complex algorithm is not always better as soon as you start accounting for edge cases in what should otherwise be a generalized algorithm general performance begins to degrade exponentially the thing that razor should have going for it is numbers say that razor has people that actively use it ie click the spam button on their mail reader from time to time if we decide that our objective is to screen of spam it means that we can continue to show what appears to be a piece of spam to people and still meet our objective why not just wait for people to vote that a piece of mail is indeed spam before ever acknowledging that it could potentially be spam in other words when i razorreport a message should i be able to tell that razor has ever even seen that message because you then have a system that is ineffective to a varying degree a simplistic view would be that subscribers received a piece of spam that could have otherwise been avoided but the reality is likely that many many more individuals would have received the piece of spam when you factor in report times by having the server pretend to never have seen it you can avoid people who just rereport spam because it was already marked as spam something that is completely useless wrong razorcheck will tell you if a specific piece of mail matches something already in the database if you have the system pretend to have never seen a piece of mail how do you propose people use the system for filtering what about revocations a revocation is after the fact because a substantial number of people in this example have already decided that they do not want that message if it is marked as spam by all those people and then people start revoking it what does that mean it means that the revokers have an opinion that probably doesnt mesh with the majority no it means that the people doing the revoking have a different opinion than the people who have submitted it as spam rather the people who have reported the message as spam constitute a majority or not is something that would have to be determined in the context of the individual message instead of messing with its rating why not just put it on the whitelist if i want that zdnet mail and most people think that zdnet mail is just plain annoying then why cant i whitelist it instead of arguing with everyone about whether or not its spam you always have that ability correct me if im wrong but its not as if all mail from zdnet will be banned in the futurejust that one piece so if zdnet were to change its system to make it easier to opt out or whatever people would hopefully start unsubscribing instead of clicking the spam button its my opinion that its not my job to unsubscribe to any list that i havent subscribed to nor is it necessarily in my best interest given that some parties sending unwanted communications may utilize the unsubscribe request as a method of determining they are mailing a valid address the inherent problem here of course is that someone can pretend to be people and block anything they choose but say you still have a lightweight trust system built in where when they agree with the majority though they couldnt have known because razor hadnt acknowledged anything yet then your trust rating goes up and vice versa the key here is that in order to be reliable you need the numbers what am i missing here see above patrick greenwell asking the wrong questions is the leading cause of wrong answers this sfnet email is sponsored by dice the leading online job board for hightech professionals search and apply for tech jobs today _______________________________________________ razorusers mailing list razoruserslistssourceforgenet

hi all i have a question which is a bit tricky and was wondering of anyone has come across this problem before or could point me in the right direction i am involved in porting a sco unix application to linux and we have encountered a problem with the way semaphores are being handled the application uses mulitple processes to run application code with the main process known as the bsh which controls all io be it screen or file io syncronisation is handled via semaphores in certain circumstances the main process and the application child process seem to lock up both waiting for the syncronisation semaphores to change state i have attached ddd to the processes and it seems that the semaphore code is doing the correct things for syncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the semop system call i have also noticed that if i introduce a slight delay between changing semaphore states the problem goes away but this causes our entire application to run really sloooww lol is there anything weird or different with the standard implemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could cause a semop to fail to pick up the change in state in a semaphore immediately setting sem_flg ipc_nowait and checking for errno eagain and recalling semop if the semop call fails also fixes the problem but again system performance goes down the toilet both the parent controlling process run as the same uid and the parent creates the semaphores with permissions any pointers would be appreciated rgds colin nevin __________________________________________________ do you yahoo everything youll ever need on one web page from news and sport to email and music charts irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

screening to all i have read the series of emails related to the unauthorized uc santa cruz screening that was scheduled for june i sincerely appreciate ieees good faith effort to correct the mistake consequently so as not to inconvenience the people planning to attend the screening i want to give ieee and sluglug permission to screen revolution os at pm on june i would ask the members of svlug to hold off on attending the screening for the simple reason that i am trying to get revolution os booked into the camera in san jose and i would prefer that svlugs members have a chance to see a nice mm print of the film if my distributor is unable to book the film into a theater in the bay area i promise that i will work with svlug to quickly set up a screening for its members i realize there may be some members of sluglug who are unhappy that i originally requested that they not hold an unauthorized screening of revolution os there are several reasons why i made the request and none of them have anything to do with me wanting to be a jerk one sluglug member commented that it was odd that a movie about the open source movement would not be available for open viewings another sluglug member remarked that my request smacks of bill gatess open letter to hobbyists the bottomline is that i did make a film about the open source movement but to assume that automatically means that the film is itself open sourced seems to be a little bit of a stretch if i made a movie about the history of vegetarianism that would not automatically mean im a vegetarian i simply thought open source and free software were compelling subjects worth exploring and documenting as a result i came to admire many aspects of the open source movement and chose to focus the documentary on the movements positive history however i do not think i should be punished for telling the story of free software and open source by having my intellectual property misappropriated more practically my feelings about open sourcing revolution os are abundantly clear when you see the explicit copyright notice at the end of the films credits i realize that making a videotape copy for personal use from a tv airing is considered fair use i believe in a healthy fair use doctrine however there is a big difference between viewing your personal copy at home with a few friends and holding a publicly advertised screening on a university campus so i freely admit my objection to unauthorized screenings of revolution os does echo bill gatess letter personally i believe that the creator of a piece of intellectual property should retain the choice to open source their ip if the open source movement is not voluntary then it is really just piracy one of the reasons i am concern with unauthorized group screenings of the film is that my distributor is planning in a few weeks to begin selling vhs copies of the film for educationalinstitutional use with a license permitting noncommercial large group screenings we hope to use the money from these sales to fund the authoring and replication of the dvd i want to release the dvd as soon as possible but i can not afford to take on anymore revolution osrelated debt thus the importance of preserving the educationalinstitutional market frequently i will read comments on slashdot and other mailing lists that justify the piracy of music on the grounds that it benefits the artists and only hurts the greedy record labels well in the case of revolution os there is no multinational media conglomerate to punish its just me i made and financed the film on my own i have worked fulltime for almost three years without a salary the only way i will get out of debt and have a chance to make another film is if people seek out legal opportunities to view revolution os i truly appreciate the enthusiasm of the open source community for revolution os and i am grateful that people do want to see it if you will just bare with me i will figure out a way for all interested persons to legally view it i hope the dust up over the unauthorized and now authorized screening at uc santa cruz has not inconvenienced anyone sincerely jts moore director revolution os irish linux

wrong vmslike async io makes a huge difference in even what i consider small programs so it sounds as if to your thinking most useful apps are also trivial unless each key on my keyboard were to the apps distinct event sources i cant think of any of my usual job mix that would need hundreds or even tens of async requests perhaps you can explain how nontrivial apps will be compellingly useful but its still not built in who knows when it will be the point is its not portable in either case does that lack of portability imply it isnt generally useful when it was apparent that tcp networks were useful berkeley sockets could be found even on vms and win boxen why would early unix have run with the idea that if one wishes to do multiple things at the same time one can use a group of processes to do them they had multics as a counterexample in the days of tiny memories and tapes people were more accustomed to writing programs that didnt run entirely in a single address space one is a great number for an interface as log is and specification can be implicit some combination of the above now as hoare says there are two ways of constructing a software design one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies as programmers weve been able to make our lives complicated for at least half a century the hardware interrupt gives us the rope part of dijkstras inspiration for the was the counterexample of ibms multi programmed boxes were these the same ones that inspired mythical man month and i suppose he would say the question is how not to make a mess of it how should we structure computations so if we try to do ten times as many things at the same time reasoning about the resulting system is at most ten times more complex not one hundred and certainly not three and a half million times more compared to that project the prospect of writing a driver library for various vendors aio implementations seems to be truly trivial dave oracle in their quest for portability used to use raw disks for the database this finessed the filesystem issue did it also allow them to roll their own set of async drivers

firewalls digest thu jul volume issue in this issue re qos fw disable some sites dnat with iptables question re dnat with iptables question from george j jahchan firewallstechinteractivenetworksnet subject re qos date thu jul so im forced to conclude that the packetshaper either sucks in a major way or that your explanationthe explanation that you have been given of it is wrong sorry you are wrong on both counts explanation is valid for symmetrical tcp for others see explanations below yes all packets in an established tcp connection have the ack flag set so all packets except syns are candidates for delay when traffic limits are exceeded whoops you should change that to are always candidates for predictive or preventive delay acks are delayed per flow in such a way that wanbound traffic reaching the edge routers ethernet interface does not exceed wan link speed no router queues it does not wait for the link to be at or near saturation to act that is why unlike queueing it is predictive and not reactive it slows down the rate of transmission of sending hosts on a perflow basis to accommodate wan link speed limit and current network utilization rather than fill up queues at lan speeds and empty them at wan speeds eventually dropping the excess once the queues fill up informing hosts to slow down their rate of transmission once queues are beyond a fixed threshold rate control works equally well for outbound and inbound traffic ever heard of an effective queueing technology for inbound traffic queueing packets after they have crossed a congested link does not make much sense does it re ipsecgre or other encapsulated traffic it obviously can not dissect ipsecgre or other encapsulated traffic it sees the tunnel as one connection if the tunneling device is before the ps on the lan side vpn gateway and router are two separate devices ps between them if the router does the tunneling then the ps sees clear traffic typically in an organization the first scenario would be the case at headquarters and the second at branch offices the ps at the branch sees traffic inside the tunnel whereas the unit at hq sees all traffic as one tunnel which allows full management of both tunneled and clear traffic at both ends udp and asymmetrical tcp where the ps and router only see the outgoing packet return traffic coming back through a satellite downlink to a station on the lan are handled differently for asymmetrical tcp it will time the release of packets to the receiving device thereby indirectly timing the release of acknowledgements by the receiving host this informs the senders tcpip stack that it should slow the release of packets because limited bandwidth is available for udp it utilizes flowbased derivative random drop it selectively drops only one packet at a time from flows that are predicted to cause congestion which prevents heavy retransmissions and application timeouts icmp packets exceeding policy limits are dropped _maybe_ you can do a special case for tcp and try to offload some of the queueing on the endpoints but i really dont see the real gain in that the real gain is manageability and control a lan host only knows about the state of its own connections and is oblivious to wan conditions until its tcpip stack learns when router queues are nearly full that the wan is congested a ps will predict and inform the lan hosts tcpip stacks of the speed limit to obey for every connection based on policies and network conditions avoiding congestion control for asymmetrical tcp and udp may not be as tight as for symmetrical tcp but it does work queueing is akin to deploying cops only when traffic jams occur vs rate control where cops are permanently deployed throughout town communicating with each other and with a central control point predicting upcoming congestion and regulating traffic ensuring a smooth flow of traffic if there is potential for congestion it will take a driver a hell of lot longer to cross town with first approach than it will with the second do you agree original message from mikael olsson mikaelolssonclavistercom to george j jahchan firewallstechinteractivenetworksnet cc firewalls list firewallsiscorg sent wednesday july pm subject re qos george j jahchan wrote the whole purpose of the device is to proactively prevent wan congestion it sits between client and server client insideserver outside or client outsideserver inside it does not make any difference and proactively adjusts the tcp window size by delaying the acknowledgement to get the sending host to honor the speed limit for that individual connection calculated in realtime based on userdefined policies and current network conditions umm dont get me wrong here but i think youve been fed a lessthan accurate sales pitch lets ponder this for a minute the device works by delaying acks that is packets with the ack flag set right letting this sink in for a while yes all packets in an established tcp connection have the ack flag set so all packets except syns are candidates for delay when traffic limits are exceeded whoops okay lets assume for a second that the packets arent actually delayed but that the ack sequence numbers or tcp window size fields are rewritten dicey all youve accomplished is move the queueing delaying from the traffic shaper to the endpoints you still get ltol delays big deal if it happens on the wire or in the stack also convincing endpoints to do delays probably results in lessthanperfect shaping since stack retransmit timings suddenly affect the actual bandwidth available rather than having the shaper itself do it the shaper knows exactly when there is bandwidth available but this doesnt even begin to touch on other protocols like udp or icmp or for that matter ipsecgrewhatever tunneled traffic neither of them have sequence numbers or window sizes that you can manipulate so im forced to conclude that the packetshaper either sucks in a major way or that your explanationthe explanation that you have been given of it is wrong sorry what i think happens is that the delay is msec as long as traffic limits arent exceeded this is reasonable but when traffic exceeds the limits things will begin to be queued now with a wellbehaved tcp stack this _will_ mean that it will fall back to lower transmission rates this is how tcp was designed so that part isnt all wrong and again this kind of shaping isnt rocket science that is not to say that there are shapers out there that are just being plain dumb always queueing and the selecting what gets transmitted out of the queue but well i just cant see that you can get any smarter than queueing when limits are actually exceeded _maybe_ you can do a special case for tcp and try to offload some of the queueing on the endpoints but i really dont see the real gain in that respectfully mikael olsson mikael olsson clavister ab storgatan box se örnsköldsvik sweden phone mobile fax www its july im on

original message from hiemstra brenno sent donderdag juli to michael zhao hiemstra brenno cc firewallslistsgnacnet subject re disable some sites michael if i was in your shoes i would first investigate if there is a security policy in your organisation if you dont know what i mean by a security policy i would advice you to start reading about it a search on google would be of a big help for you if there is a security policy i would read it and investigate what is tells about how employees are able to use their workstations for performing their function in a security policy there should be things what employees are allowed to do on the network internet and what not if there isnt a security policy i would advice you to implement one in your company because without one you cant punish employees by violating the policy and if there is a court case you dont have any rock solid thing to smack around with without a policy you are just implementing solutions to prevent employees in doing things that im my opinion they arent allowed to do on their workstations anyway i dont like the idea that employees play games use kazaa icq msn etc etc in stead of working what we pay them to do this is why a security policy is important because then you can say to employees that they violated it and that there are consequences for that deny internet access etc etc owkee now that this is out of the way time to proceed about the proxy thingie a proxy dont have to be the default gateway of your network to use it it is a function in internet explorer or whatever browser you use in your network if you ask me checkpoint firewalls are just good in using for what their real purpose is and that is firewalling a network i dont like the idea that my firewall is also cvs http thingie because i dont think a firewall is its purpose to do that proxies are a much better solutions for that and they are also developed for that purpose depending on your network setup and the os and proxy brand of your current proxy you have several solutions which was already provided by people on this list my favorite proxy is squid and there are probably a lot of http blacklist programs that work with squid to block websites and stuff i still think you should first deny direct internet traffic from workstations and only allow traffic to the internet from servers that are allowed to do so you should think about proxies email servers etc etc this should also prevent people from playing games especially those quake kinda games because those use ports that arent necessary for normal webbrowsing games running over port and not http related are blocked by the proxy if that proxy is a true layer application layer proxy these kinda proxies can view in the tcpip packet and see if this is legitimate http traffic or that someone tries to tunnel something over port anyway again food for some thoughts regards brenno original message from michael zhao smtpmzhaoeverlastingsystemscom sent woensdag juli to hiemstra brenno cc firewallslistsgnacnet subject re disable some sites thanks your reply i built up my network three years ago i have proxy which we only use cache to accelerate our internet accessing it is not a gateway it is too difficult to change the topology many thing need to be changed did you have another idea to help me someone suggest me to buy the websence but i dont have the budget right now thanks a lot michael hiemstra brenno wrote michael the first thing is to build a security policy that states what people are allowed to do and what not everyone needs to accept this policy and if they violate it you can apply rules that you state in your security policy if i had the option for your network setup i would install a proxy server and demand every client to connect to the proxy if they want to use the internet the proxy will only allow http ftp and other approved services to connect to the internet and you can let them check to some database which websites are allowed and deny access to sites that arent allowed your company firewall will only allow the proxy to connect to the internet clients are denied this way the clients cant connect directly to the internet game servers and on the proxy you can deny clients to connect to the game servers i hope this is an option for you regards brenno original message from michael zhao

once upon a time mark wrote i remember aptget distupgrading from to fine so it should work maybe ive done that too on many production servers the only little unimportant catch is to replace kernelheaders by glibckernheaders a simple aptget install glibckernheaders taking care of that upgrading between releases is meant to work not between betas or beta and releases the reason is simple some packages may have been downgraded some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different dependencies for both these categories of packages the upgrade through aptrhnwhatever just wont do as some older packages might be considered as the newest thus being kept on the system as red hat does i really dont recommend trying to upgrade between betas or from a beta to a final release either simply backup your home etc and root andor usrlocal if needed then reinstall cleanly itll probably save a few hassles and youll get the cleanest possible system matthias matthias saou world trade center edificio norte planta system and network engineer barcelona spain electronic group interactive phone _______________________________________________ rpmlist mailing list rpmlistfreshrpmsnet

quoting wintermute couteircomnet no as of oh about a year to a year and a half ago suse revoked its free offering of its retail distro sometime about the start of the great slump suse pulled free release of its main x product so the last free version of suse you could get via a linux format par example was i think lets limit the discussion to x to simplify there are some additional complications for some of the other architectures essentially they make most of the other architectures iso images available gratis because they arent selling boxed sets and want the public to have them anyway the isos include thirdparty proprietary apps but of necessity not the highlyrestricted ones available in boxed set editions you can get a singledisk iso image of suse evaluation edition version _lots_ of places including here ftpftpsusecompubsuseievaluationevaluationiso you could wget r or equivalent the entire ftp edition for lack of an official name for it from here or mirror sites ftpftpsusecompubsusei please note the restricted rights granted for use of the suseoriginated yast program specifically stated here ftpftpsusecompubsuseicopyrightyast a grant of limited redistribution rights to the distribution as a whole apparently covering the ftp edition and the evaluation edition is stated here ftpftpsusecompubreadmemirrorpolicy quoting please make sure that you meet the following conditions if you intend to mirror ftpsusecom suse linux yast in particular may not be reproduced on cds or other media for value reproduction for personal or educational use is explicitly allowed and encouraged im not sure on the details of it but i think suse have probably done an openbsd of the cd they sell openbsd foundation assert a compilation copyright over the openbsd official iso image a compilation copyright is the copyright monopoly that for example the editor of a set of thirdparty short stories receives even though he didnt write any of the constituent stories he put creative work into selecting arranging and editing those stories the law recognises such efforts as creative works deserving copyright protection if there is sufficient creative effort a judge would decide if someone made a court case of it courts have held on the other hand that arrangement and publication of alphabetical telephone listings in a yellow pages telephone directory the advertising section dont have anywhere near enough creative content to support an overreaching telcos claim of compilation copyright the court politely said nice try in effect the openbsd foundations claim may be a bit of a legal bluff too theoretically one could get around it by creating a slightly different set of iso images thereby finessing the claim of compilation copyright but nobody bothers because openbsd foundation actually charges only a very reasonable price for jewelcase sets and nobody wants to endure the barrage of hatemail from theo co ive never seen any claim from suse of compilation copyright on its isos or distribution as a whole i could be wrong i dont use suse so havent investigated but essentially the only free version of suse will be its ftp offering again the ftp edition and the evaluation edition may be redistributed moreorless freely as long as its not for value ditto the liveeval edition which is a demo only the three boxed sets contents may not cheers a good man has few enemies a ruthless man has none rick moen ricklinuxmafiacom irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

______________________________________________________ the iso newsletter edition ______________________________________________________ welcome to the fourth edition of the iso newsletter designed to keep you abreast of news and developments with respect to iso and information security the information contained in this newsletter is absolutely free to our subscribers and provides guidance on various practical issues plus commentary on recent information security incidents guidance and information included in this issue the iso toolkit uncovered social engineering are you susceptible iso a world wide phenomena stranger danger iso more frequently asked questions credit card transactions minimize the risks bsi certifications congratulations iso section bcp review it couldnt happen here could it subscription information the iso toolkit uncovered the iso standard can be acquired either stand alone or as part of an introductory pack appropriately called the iso toolkit but why was it packaged thus and what is included in the pack the purpose of the toolkit is to help organizations get off to a flying start with respect to iso not only to understand the standard itself but to begin to address many of the standards requirements more quickly the contents can be broken down into two groups those that help the organization to understand where iso fits and what is involved in embracing it and those that help an organization to take the first critical steps to compliance in the former group are the roadmap to certification which broadly describes the process of gaining certification the xl management presentation which explains the history background and current status of the standard and of course the iso standard itself both parts in the latter group are some key items to aid compliance these include a comprehensive set of iso compliant security policies to address section security policy and business continuity audit checklists to help address section business continuity management it doesnt end there however for the audit section there is a detailed set of audit questionnaires to address various issues and platforms for newcomers to information security there is even a substantial glossary of terms clearly creating such a toolkit was a significant undertaking however in terms of helping organizations exploring the initial stages of iso it can be invaluable more information on the iso toolkit and how to purchase can be found at the standard itself can alternatively be procured from social engineering are you susceptible the term social engineering can conjure up a variety of ideas usually based around the concept of genetic tampering however when applied to it security it has its own implications and its own vocabulary following interviews with known computer criminals a list of approaches has been produced these are designed to gather information without the target even realizing that they have parted with it the attempts are often made on an opportune bases with common locations for this sort of activity being planes trains and pubs the telephone is probably the major source of premeditated acts the following are some of the major techniques employed baiting this essentially involves asking a variety of questions including some leading questions designed to catch the right answers often items of conversation are introduced based upon replies received the fiction is legitimized with small amounts of fact in the right places pulling rank this amounts ot the perpetrator assuming a more senior position in the company than the victim and is usually enacted on the telephone it does not necessitate direct impersonation only the position needs to be assumed exhausting this involves asking a constant stream of similar questions to wear down the target surf boarding basically this is looking over someones shoulder at something confidential this could be directly through a window through a doorway etc surveys the information given freely in surveys can often be extremely useful to a criminal the surveys can initially be for entirely legitimate purposes or can be completely bogus from the start in either case sensitive information can often be obtained and unwittingly disclosed there are of course many other techniques however disclosure can be prevented via the use of a series of common sense rules and policies before releasing any information it is essential to at least establish a the sensitivity of the information b your authority to exchange or release the information c the real identity of the third party proper authentication d the purpose of the exchange the act of exchange should also be recorded for audit purposes iso a world wide phenomina disney would have said its a small world after all but the global take on of iso proves that organizations the planet over are embracing it with enthusiasm to illustrate the global nature of the standard we recently created a table from the last purchases of the standard from the iso electronic shop wwwisonet the figures below do come with a serious health warning though the electronic shop is a credit card purchase system some cultures are not as comfortable or familiar as others with credit card purchase and will therefore have their purchase position significantly understated an example is india which acquires substantial numbers of the standard only two of which show in the last from the download location that aside the table makes interesting reading argentina australia austria barbados belgium bermuda bosnia and herzegovina

you read this article look around at your working environment the itemsinformation you have to hand may not seem very sensitive because you deal with them every day but now look again if you were alone and not a member of staff how would you view them what would you find if you looked around picture yourself as a visitor passing through what can you hear in terms of conversation what can you see the chances are that you can hear and see quite a lot that you would not want to be openly disclosed to the outside world if this is the case the security of your information is at risk potentially from every visitor stranger subcontractor etc this article is not written with the intention of discrediting visitors but nonetheless it is important to be fully aware of what can happen if due caution is not exercised the following guidelines may help in ensuring that the risks are minimized your receptionvisitor area should issue distinctive badges and ensure that visitors wear them consider using different colored badges for each day of the week challenge those who are not displaying any identity badges if your location issues identity badges make sure you wear yours do not be afraid to ask someone who they are visiting and what they are doing do not be lazy escort visitors from reception if applicable dont let them make their way to you do not hold doors open for people not displaying their id do not leave visitors alone iso more frequently asked questions how many controls are there in the standard part is organized into sections there are main controls and over detailed controls in total what is part part basically explains how to apply the standard itself and how to build and operate an information security management system how old is it the standard stems from an original publication in from the dti in the uk it became bs in and of course iso in what is accreditation an accreditation body can authorize others to certify third parties under the standard p a number of accreditation bodies exist in different countries is certification for life no it is normally for three year periods iso is used throughout the world but was it internationally created yes indeed the latest versions included input from representatives from many nations including australia brazil germany norway uk and usa amongst others is it linked to a specific national legal system no it is generic in terms of legislation credit card transactions minimize the risks the use of credit and debit cards to purchase goods and services has become an everyday convenience that we take for granted but there are associated information security risks which we should pause to consider especially when making payments over the internet web sites are becoming an increasingly popular means of purchasing goods and services but they have also become popular targets for cyber criminals who often use stolen credit card numbers to purchase goods which can then be easily exchanged for cash there are also relatively simple technologies now readily available which could be used by hackers to surreptitiously steal vast amounts of money a few pounds at a time from millions of people a survey by the it research company gartner predicted that internet crime involving the mass victimization of consumers could take place by the end of this year we recommend the following best practice guidelines to minimize the risks involved in credit card transactions ensure that credit cards used to purchase goods or services on the internet have a low credit limit or if debit cards are used that they have limited funds and are only topped up to cover specific internet purchases all expenses incurred through internet transactions should be carefully audited on a regular basis for any anomalies only enter credit card details on a web site if you are confident as to its authenticity and that the connection is secure the prefix as opposed to the usual http in the web site address indicates a secure connection if the security of a web site is in doubt any confidential information posted to it may be exposed to malicious intent be extremely cautious when posting confidential details on any site where the internet service provider hosting the site is not verified note that we have prechecked all sites referenced in this newsletter for security if ordering by telephone using a credit card ensure that you are talking to the correct person if you are unsure whether the organization you are dealing with will handle your details sensitively pay by some other means lost or stolen credit card details may be used for internet transactions inform the card issuer and relevant person within your organization immediately if a company credit card is lost or stolen bsi

number of other certification bodies across the world iso section bcp review business continuity planning is covered by section of the standard a core requirement of which is the creation and maintenance of a business continuity plan creating such a plan from scratch is a difficult undertaking of course this is one reason why software products were produced unfortunately these often become problematic in themselves difficult to learn expensive etc recent times have therefore seen a move to simplification with organizations keen to avoid adding complexity to an already complex task at the vanguard of this change was a product developed entirely in msword the bcp generator this was designed from top down to simplify business continuity planning it comprises two components a plan template and an interactive guide the latter using word macros to jump to and fro into the correct part of the template its impact upon the business continuity scene has been substantial with organizations from the very largest to the smallest embracing the tool and its concepts it is in active use in over countries with this change of emphasis in the business continuity planning market there is now no excuse for not creating a full recovery plan the old lines of too expensive and too difficult are now less hollow than they ever were although section is very clear with respect to the need of a comprehensive plan it is surely also a matter of due diligence to have one and equally irresponsibility not to have one for information on the bcp generator see for information on business continuity generally see it couldnt happen herecould it every issue of the iso newsletter features at least one true story of an information security breach and its consequences again in this issue we focus upon low tech but high impact incidents on th october a contract programmer who had once worked for a large us based bank walked into the inner sanctum of the main building the security guards remembered him as someone permitted to do so in the dealing room he claimed to be conducting a quality audit and interrogated a junior employee and watched a program run noting down security codes as they were entered he then left and hung around outside until just after normal trading time he then rang the bank from a public phone box and initiated an electronic funds transfer using the codes m

using the default password of a system engineer which had never been changed this gave him considerable scope and powers of access to cover for himself however he semidisabled the machine log changed

considerable cost over a period of nine months the number of computer malfunctions within a large company had risen from an average of two per year to critical levels the impact was such that the business fell behind with its invoicing systems and had to buy processing and backup from third parties as it could not deliver some of its services reliably it started to lose the confidence of its customers the situation began to spiral eventually the company suspected foul play may be involved and called the police secret surveillance equipment was installed to monitor staff one was filmed

craig rhughes wrote i was thinking you could easily create a spamtrap which you subscribe to lots of legitimate nonspam mailing lists plus you also spread the email address around and get it in the hands of lots of spammers so it ends up receiving large quantities of both spam and nonspam then you have it apply the algorithm above to the incoming mail stream so it could be thousands of actual real different emails per day the very high rate triggers alarms thing is certainly something which would be possible to check for but there may be legitimate ways to exhibit this behavior cant think of one right now but aol proxy server springs to mind as an example from another domain if there is a maximum trust value if trust is some sort of percentage for instance and if it isnt impossible to reach it that would prevent too few people to get too much of an avantage my guess is if of razor users can reach this limit or be near enough spammers wont be able to cheat just by building up their trust they would need a fair amount of fake users too now for the fair amount of fake users spammers dont have access to many set of network classes so they would need a bunch of users coming from the same set of ips if the razor servers see people on a class c network ips reporting emails a day something wrong is going on this could also trigger alarms as for legitimate proxies and the like a proxy should not report any thing spam should be reported by hand not automatically there may be a way to have exception ibm networks would have lots of users from the same set of ips but no likely spammers so no alarm would trigger for their network or better the alarm would be less sensitive aol could still give trouble though but even then for one particular phone linecable the set of ip is probably quite small even less than a class c using network subclassing the spammers could still try to have several connections at different locations but that increases their cost and so is not so much interesting jehan this sfnet email is sponsored by dice the leading online job board for hightech professionals search and apply for tech jobs today _______________________________________________ razorusers mailing list razoruserslistssourceforgenet

oates isaac wrote first people will have seen the piece of spam that couldve been avoided but the other will never see that spam evenly distributed it means that an average user will only see of spam thats not realistic because not everyone will get the same spam but the basic threshold can be adjusted at the very least people need to vote on a given piece of mail to make a realistic decision since theres no no vote mechanism except revocationand thats after the fact only a yes vote mechanism exists and so if you received yes votes then you could safely say that you got a reasonable sample im not sure that i follow your reasoning here razor isnt your mail server it doesnt keep in your mail you dont request your mail there nor do most people check for spam only when they are going to read their mail my setup check a mail against razor when my server receives it not when im going to read it if you wait to get reply for a mail it means you have to wait for people to read it at least some people may not vote because they dont want to vote that day or because they dont think its spam knowing that about half the planet would be sleeping night time and thus not reading their mail it would mean that at least people already received the mail in their inbox knowing that among the people who are not sleeping not all of them are constantly reading their mail i would say that less than people over read their mail as soon as it arrives that means that people already recieved the mail and checked it against the razor database before you would get your votes also with your system is the best you could get if you wait for only one vote maybe only guy would read the mail to vote sleeping and not reading their mail soon enough wich gives a value thats far better than your dont you think in reallifetm most likely one guy voting wont be enough but the thing is that it will stop the spam as early as possible also if for some reason this mail is one of those people dont agree on whether it is spam or not it would take a while to revoke those reports which means that some people may lose this legitimate to them mail you mentioned that with this system people will rereport less often first i dont see how waiting longer before making a decision on the legitimacy of a mail will reduce rereporting the more you wait the more people will get the mail in their inbox the more people will see the mail again not everybody check their mail against razor at read time most do it a reception time using procmailspamassassin second rereporting has its use it increase the confidence that a mail is spam so i dont see what you gain with your people jehan this sfnet email is sponsored by dice the leading online job board for hightech professionals search and apply for tech jobs today _______________________________________________ razorusers mailing list razoruserslistssourceforgenet

on thu sep bill stoddard wrote how likely are you to change someones mind by being rude and disrespectful to them is this how to win friends and influence people point the first i doubt if they are trying to change rumsys mind but rather to show others that there is a vocal and violent opposition to his views with such flagrant showings of opposition there would be more coverage of the opposing ideas and thus the spreading of the dissenting meme a viri need not comply with the wishes of the attacked host rather the host had better make some antibodies or learn to adapt point the second historicaly the in yer face mode of confrontation has been used to gain popular support and to grow from seeds grass roots movements witness the big bold in yer face signature of hancock on the in yer face declaration of the american colonies to the governing powers of england witness also the chicago seven others will follow in examplare form upon digging now point the third is it annoying yes and if your annoyed then the in yer facers have done thier job sad to say the polite persnikiters are teh very fule the in yer facers hope to ignite if your burning your being used pointed the personalthe politics of the polite are more often the refuge of backstabings closed mouth recourlessness and hypocritcal behavoirs id rather hear what those who oppose me have to say than quietly be knifed by the slow hand of the coward seek not the polite or impolite but rather the reasons why tom good points all but they dont apply in this case someone is speaking and a group of selfish bastards only interested in getting their rocks off are trying to shout him down they are doing it because its good for the soul kind like chuckie manson doing the stuff he did cause it was good for his soul unprincipled and evil its got nothing to do with throwing tea in the harbor or the doi bill

the workaround is to pass an extra argument to configure as follows configure programprefix_program_prefix_program_prefix this works when you are defining a switch that configure does not already define but how can we override an existing switch for example prefix usrlocal configure prefix_prefixprefix would be desirable for making a rpm package relocatable but this doesnt work configure receives two switches the default prefixusr and the attempted override prefixusrlocal but it only recognizes the first one _______________________________________________ rpmlist mailing list rpmlistfreshrpmsnet

cwgdatedceaedeepeddycom said i just checked in a code cleanup which doesnt address this issue but does take a machete to code right around it you ought to cvs update and see if your issue becomes any clearer with all the brush removed my patch notes that msgid and line are redundant with one another and removes one or the other from functions which takes both the callers are then changed to pass what the function expects in the case of msg_change the line argument is removed and we only have the msgid argument ftoc_clearcurrent is now the first line of msgchange the following patch removes ftoc_rescanline in favour of a ftoc_rescanlines it runs scan on a list of lines and updates ftoc accordingly the patch also changes all the callers to make use of it it also changes ftoc_clearcurrent to work of an argument instead of falsily clearing a message thats still current on disk all in an effort to get a onetoone diskdisplay correspondence it does add ms to the execution time depending on folder size due to the invocation of scan however this version does not try to second guess the mh version of scan so if you have exotic scanlines it tells the truth as a side effect the sign now corresponds better to whats on disk comments appreciated im going to be offlike for a couple of days so i send the cvs diff rather than putting it in the cvs anders

cant think of how id be running afoul of the spam filters with this post so heres the second try kissingers book _does america need a foreign policy_ provides a few handy abstractions the ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between values idealism and interests realism and occasionally between peace and justice also he views historical american approaches to foreign policy as a bundle of three fibers hamiltonian we should only get involved in foreign adventures to preserve balances of power wilsonian we should only get involved in foreign adventures to further democracy etc jacksonian we should never get involved in foreign adventures unless were attacked then we go rambo he has tactfully left out the hard realists as for the rest i gather wilsonians play the idealists and hamiltonians act where values and interests intersect and jacksonians act only when values and interests overlap kissinger himself seems to be a hamiltonian much of the book is about how he thinks we ought to be shaping the balance of power in various foreign regions maybe ive been too affected by kant but i cant see that such a strategy works unless one can count on a bismarck runnning it how lopsided does the us look if everyone tries to run a balance of power politics dave the road to empire leads to domestic decay because in time the claims of omnipotence erode domestic restraints no empire has avoided the road to caesarism unless like the british empire it devolved its power before this process could develop in longlasting empires every problem turns into a domestic issue which should be handled very differently from international ones because the outside world no longer provides a counterweight and as challenges grow more diffuse and increasingly remote from the historic domestic base internal struggles become ever more bitter and in time violent a deliberate quest for hegemony is the surest way to destroy the values that made the united states great kings and tyrants generically have followed the same power politics garner popular support by keeping potential oligarchs down in other traditions a king is a legitimate tyrant and a tyrant an illegitimate king in the us id hope that we like samuel wouldnt naturally make such fine distinctions

when i get a box i dont want any of that integrated chipset crap whether its for winblows or linux its just like ibm mwave dsp chip shared videomain memory in the old days i know you can flip a mboard jumper switch to turn crap off and install your own cards but why bother to clarify my point is this dell makes excellent machines and i would recomend their machines and their aftersales support over any other manufacturer that i can think of however if you want that box for linux and you have a life and you dont want to spend a week of it fucking arround and googling to get that box working properly be damned sure you do your research before you buy it and this especially applies to their budget machines and this isnt taking a swing at you john but just a bad thing for those that hope a distro will work out of the box a lot of the time the reason that you encounter this is cause someone has such a box and they say to you hey can you install that linux code that i got from the guy in the internet cafe and you say sure and you go to their house without a net connectionk modem and the machine has got this crap windoze only hardware and eventually you shrug in frustration and they say well i didnt expect much from something thats free anyhow when dell were squabbling with windows and it looked as though there might be a dellredhat alliance my inspiron was produced it worked a treat now that dell doesnt give a shit about linux all their new cheap boxes are linux incompatable in small ways b original message from john p looney mailtovalentuathaorg sent august to iluglinuxie subject re ilug dell gx v redhat on fri aug at am hunt bryan mentioned im not knocking dell in general my next machine is going to be a dell but buying a random dell box is likely to result in much tearing out of hair buying any new machine is going to cause problems with a six month old set of drivers same happens in windows you have to go get your drivers yes dell use the most recent stuff they can to save money thats not a bad thing just a bad thing for those that hope a distro will work out of the box kate irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

gcc glibc and binutils which the lfs site says not to optimise already determines what system youre compiling on and optimises itself to that thats my understanding of how it works anyway john subject re ilug optimizing for pentium pt on fri jul at pm john gay wrote a while ago i asked what other packages i should optomize for pentium one person answered glibc this got me thinking about gcc itself so i asked on another list and got a few answers most were dont even think about it but a few suggested gcc and one pointed me to linux from scratch why or more specifically what do you mean on one hand you can optimise how gcc is compiled all that will do is make it generate the exact same code just a smidge faster and since gcc is such a memory pig youd do better to buy more ram to up your fs cache hits and to keep gccs heap out of swap on the other side you can look into patches to gcc that affect its code generation um ok but keep in mind that compiler errors suck i cant express that enough compilers should just work perfectly always doing anything that might affect that is in my opinion insane theyre hard to trace and youd better have a deep knowledge of whats going on to either report bugs to the patch developers or to fix it yourself plus my understanding is that gcc would need major changes to get large speed boosts on x chips kevin irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

i cant believe i actually read a laughoutloud funny profile of the fcc commissioner fer crissakes so the following article comes recommended a fine explanation of michael powells extraordinary equivocation on the other hand i can also agree with werbachs werblog entry rohit a trip to fcc world nicholas lemann has a piece in the new yorker this week about fcc chairman michael powell its one of the first articles ive seen that captures some of powells real personality and the way hes viewed in washington unfortunately lemann ends by endorsing conventional political wisdom after describing how powell isnt really a firebreathing ideological conservative he concludes that in essence powell favors the inumbent local bell telephone companies while a democratic fcc would favor new entrants i know thats not how powell sees the world and though i disagree with him on many issues i think hes right to resist the old dichotomy the telecom collapse should be a humbling experience for anyone who went through it the disaster wasnt the regulators fault as some conservatives argue but something clearly went horribly wrong and policymakers should learn from that experience contrary to lemanns speculation the upstart carriers wont be successful in a gore administration because its too late virtually all of them are dead and wall street has turned off the capital tap for the foreseeable future some may survive but as small players rather than worlddominators the battle between clecs and rbocs that lemann so astutely parodies is old news the next important battle in telecom will be between those who want to stay within the traditional boxes and those who use different models entirely thats why open broadband networks and open spectrum are so important whatever the regulatory environment there is going to be consolidation in telecom those left out in that consolidation will face increasing pressure to create new pipes into the home or slowly die the victors in the consolidation game will cut back on innovation and raise prices which will create further pressure for alternatives lemann is right that policymaking looks much drier and more ambiguous on the ground than through the lens of history but hes wrong in thinking that telecoms future will be something like its past friday october am comments the chairman by nicholas lemann hes the other powell and no one is sure what hes up to new yorker october last year my middle son in eighth grade and encountering his first fairly serious americanhistory course indignantly reported that the whole subject was incomprehensible i was shocked what about gettysburg and the declaration of independence and the selmatomontgomery march just look at my textbook he said and when i did i saw his point his class had got up to the eighteenforties what i expected was a big beefing up of the roles of sacagawea and crispus attucks and indeed there was some of that but the main difference between my sons text and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in american history there were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and reciprocal trade agreements i skipped ahead past the civil war hoping for easier going only to encounter currency floats and the regulation of freight rates only a few decades into the twentieth century did it become possible to see the federal governments main function as responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests even now if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in washington what youd find is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage not so much over the public as over each other agribusiness versus real estate banks versus insurance companies and so on the arena in which this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them its an insiders game less because the players are secretive than because the public and the pressencouraged by the players who speak in jargon cant get themselves interested one corner of washington might be called fcc world for the federal communications commission fcc world has perhaps five thousand denizens they work at the commission itself at the house and senate commerce committees and at the washington offices of the companies that the commission regulates they read communications daily subscription price a year and every year around christmastime they grumblingly attend the chairmans dinner at a washington hotel where the high point of the evening is a scripted supposedly selfdeprecating comedy routine by the commissions chairman of all the federal agencies and commissions the fcc is the one that americans ought to be most interested in after all it is involved with a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the american economy as well as important aspects of daily lifetelephone and television and radio and newspapers and the internet and right now fcc world is in if not a crisis at least a very soapy lather because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the corporate scandals concerns the economic collapse of companies regulated by the fcc qwest worldcom adelphia and global crossing among others are or were part of fcc world aol time warner is part of fcc world jack grubman the former salomon smith barney analyst who seems to have succeeded kenneth lay of enron as the embodiment of the corporate scandals is part of fcc world in the past two years companies belonging to fcc world have lost trillions of dollars in stockmarket valuation and have collectively served as a dead weight pulling down the entire stock market this year an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state of the fcc has been circulating widely within fcc world it evokes fcc worlds feverish mood the fcc is fiddling while rome burns and suggests why nobody besides residents of fcc world has thought of the commission in connection with the corporate scandals the sentence i just quoted is followed by this explanation the ilecs appear likely to enter all ld markets within twelve months while losing virtually no residential customers to attackers since and suffering about market share loss in business lines to clecs its a lot easier to think about evil ceos than to decipher that even in good times fcc world pays obsessive attention to the commissions chairman in bad times the attention becomes especially intense and when the chairman is a celebrity fcc world devotes itself to fulltime chairmanwatching the current chairman michael powell is a celebrity at least by governmentofficial standards because he is the only son of colin powell the secretary of state unlike his father he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity which generates enormous and at times apoplectically toned speculation about who he really is and what hes really up to powell is young to be the head of a federal agencyhe is thirtynineand genially charming everybody likes him before becoming chairman he was for three years one of the fccs five commissioners not only is he fluent in the fccs incomprehensible patois he has a clintonesque love of the arcane details of communications policy hes always saying that hes an avid moderate and yet he has a rageinciting quality one of his predecessors as chairman reed hundt quoted in forbes compared powell to herbert hoover mark cooper of the consumer federation of america calls him radical and extreme just as often as hes accused of being a rightwing ideologue powell gets accused of being paralytically cautious it aint about singing kumbayah around the campfire another former chairman william kennard says you have to have an answer one day last spring powell testifying before a senate subcommittee delivered an anodyne opening statement and the subcommittees chairman ernest hollings of south carolina berated him you dont care about these regulations hollings said you dont care about the law or what congress sets down thats the fundamental thats the misgiving i have of your administration over there it just is amazing to me you just pellmell down the road and seem to not care at all i think youd be a wonderful executive vicepresident of a chamber of commerce but not a chairman of a regulatory commission at the government level are you happy in your job extremely powell said with an amiable smile one can not understand powells maddening effect at least on democrats and liberal activists without understanding not just the stated purpose of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose the fcc was created by congress in but it existed in prototype well before the new deal because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy cases for government intervention in the private economy making sure that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves its other original function was preventing american telephone telegraph the national monopoly phone company from treating its customers unfairly over the decades as fcc world grew up into a comfortable wellestablished place the fcc segued into the role of industrial supervisionits real purpose it was supposed to manage the competition among communications companies so that it didnt become too bloody by artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business in addition to looking out for the publics interest the commission more specifically protected the interests of members of congress many of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most terrifying category of interest groupyou can cross the local bank president and live to tell the tale but not the local broadcaster according to an ofttold fcc world anecdote president clinton once blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers in the same city because he said if the soandso who owned the anticlinton little rock democratgazette had owned the leading tv station in little rock too clinton would never have become president fcc world may have been con tentious but it was settled too because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic niches for themselves then in the nineteeneighties the successful breakup of at tby far the biggest and most important company the commission regulateddeposited a thick additional sediment of selfconfidence onto the consciousness of fcc world a generation ago for most americans there was one local phone company one longdistance company and one company that manufactured telephones which customers were not permitted to ownand they were all the same company it was illegal to plug any device into a phone line by the midnineteennineties there were a dozen economically viable local phone companies a handful of national longdistance companies competing to offer customers the lowest price and best service and stores everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturersand millions of americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the telephone lines at t had argued for years that it was a natural monopoly requiring protection from economic competition and total control over its lines so much for that argument over the same period the fcc had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones and the internet it was the dream of federalagency success come true consumers vastly better served and the industry much bigger and more prosperous too the next big step was supposed to be the telecommunications act of one of those massive endlessly lobbiedover pieces of legislation which most people outside fcc world probably felt it was safe to ignore although the telecom act sailed under the rhetorical banner of modernization and deregulation its essence was a grand interestgroup bargain in which the local phone companies known to headline writers as baby bells and to fcc world as arbocks the pronounced version of rbocs or regional bell operating companies would be permitted to offer longdistance service in exchange for letting the longdistance companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for customers consumers would win because for the first time they would get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more competition than they already had in long distance but the politics and economics of the telecom act which was shepherded through congress by vicepresident gore were just as important democrats saw the act as helping to reposition them as the technology partythe party that brought the internet into every home created hundreds of thousands of jobs in new companies and not least set off an investment boom whose beneficiaries might become the partys new contributor base clintons slogans about the information superhighway and building a bridge to the twentyfirst century which like all clinton slogans artfully sent different messages to different constituencies were the rhetorical correlates of the telecom act and gores cruise to the presidency was supposed to be powered substantially by the acts success the fcc had a crucial role in all this the arbocks are rich aggressive politically powerful and generally republican though like all important interest groups they work with both parties they immediately filed lawsuits which wound up tying the hands of their new competitors in the local phone market for more than three years through rulemaking enforcement and litigation the fcc then headed by reed hundt who was gores classmate at st albans was supposed to keep the arbocks in their cages so that not only longdistance companies like at t and mci worldcom but also a whole category of new companies seelecks the pronounced version of clecs or competitive local exchange carriers could emerge this entailed the regulatory equivalent of handtohand combat the seeleck is supposed to have access to the arbocks switching equipment the arbock wont give the seeleck a key to the room where its kept so the seeleck asks the fcc to rule that the arbock has to give it the key partly because hundt assured the seelecks and other new companies that he would protect them and partly because of the generally booming condition of the economy then investment capital flooded into the seeleckscompanies with names like winstar covad and teligentand into other telecommunications companies even not obviously related technology companies like cisco systems benefitted from the telecom boom demand for their products was supposed to come from the seelecks and other new players there would be no conflict between the interests of the new telecom companies and those of consumers as one of hundts former lieutenants told me reed used to joke that my job was to make sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up the years following the passage of the telecom act were the peak of the boom wall street had its blood up and that meant not just more startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies time warner and aol decided to throw in together and at t and comcast and so on surely worldcom and the other telecom bad guys believed that their selfdealing stockoverselling and creative accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating by the time the outcome of the presidential election had been determined the telecom crash was well under way nonetheless the chairmanship of the fcc remained one of the best jobs in terms of influence and visibility available to a career government regulator three republicans emerged as candidates powell who was a commissioner harold furchtgottroth the farthesttotheright commissioner and patrick wood the head of the texas public utility commission and as such a george w bush guy in texas however wood had crossed the most powerful person in the arbock camp edward whitacre the ceo of sbc communications which is headquartered in san antonio this meant that the arbocks didnt want wood as head of the fcc because he might be too proseeleck wood is now the head of the federal energy regulatory commission michael powell had to signal the arbocks that he wasnt as threatening as wood while also signalling the conservative movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than furchtgottroth powell did this deftly for example in december of he appeared before a conservative group called the progress freedom foundation and gave a very michael powell speechwhimsical intellectual and freeassociative biblical history joseph schumpeter moores lawthat began by making fun of the idea that the fcc should try to keep new telecom companies alive in the wake of the act the fcc is often cast as the grinch who stole christmas powell said like the whos down in whoville who feast on whopudding and rare whoroast beast the communications industry was preparing to feast on the deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the acts fertile soil but this feast the fcc grinch did not like in the least so it is thought thus powell was indicating that if he became chairman he didnt expect to administer first aid to the seelecks as part of the job he was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day of the bush administration twenty months into the administration nearly all the seelecks are dead or dying nearly all longdistance companies not just worldcom are in serious trouble cable companies have lost half their value satellite companies are staggering the crash has had an automatically concentrating effect because as new companies die the existing companies market share increases and if the existing companies are in good shape financially they have the opportunity to pick up damaged companies at bargain prices during the bush administration as the financial carnage in communications has worsened the communications industry has moved in the direction of more concentration if the bells wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service and if they also merge the country will be on its way to having a national duopoly in local service verizon in the east and sbc in the west and these companies could dominate long distance as well because of the poor health of the longdistance companies the cable business also seems close to having two dominant national companies aol time warner and comcast unlike the phone companies they dont have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more fully control what material they allow to enter peoples homes as part of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the telecom act the limits on concentration in the radio industry were significantly loosened and in the past six years the number of radiostation owners in the united states has been cut by twentyfive per cent today a large portion of local and national radio news programming is supplied by a single company westwood one a subsidiary of viacom in this situation many democrats and liberals think the fcc should be hyperactivethe superhero of government regulation springing to the rescue of both consumers and the communications industry it should try to breathe life into the seelecks and other new companies it should disallow mergers maintain ownership limits and otherwise restrain the forces of concentration it should use the governments money and muscle to get new technologyespecially fast internet connectionsinto the homes of people who cant afford it at current market prices an analogy that a lot of people in fcc world make is between telecom and the middle east the clinton people blame the bloodshed on the bush people because they disengaged when they came into office and the bush people blame it on the clinton people because they raised too many expectations and stirred too many passions but michael powells fcc has not been hyperactive powell has been conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the fcc and waiting for the federal courts and the congress to send him signals in midseptember powell finally initiated a formal review of the fccs limits on media concentration this doesnt mean he has been inactive rather he has been active in a way that further infuriates his criticsin a manner that smoothly blends the genial and the provocative he muses about whether the fundamental premises of fcc world really make sense while giving the impression that hes having the time of his life as chairman at his first press conference when he was asked what he was going to do about the digital dividethat is economic inequality in access to the internethe said you know i think there is a mercedes divide id like to have one and i cant afford one at the national cable telecommunications association convention in chicago powell following a troupe of tumblers to the stage interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a somersault not long ago i went to see powell in his office at the fcc until when the commission moved to a new building in southwest washington near the citys openair fish market fcc world was at the western edge of downtown where everybody would encounter everybody else at a few familiar restaurants and bars today the fcc building looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park even the chairmans suite though large is beige carpeted and fluorescent powell is a bulky man who wears goldrimmed glasses and walks with a pronounced limp the result of injuries he suffered in a jeep accident in germany in when he was an army officer because of the accident he left the army and went to law school where he became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation particularly the idea that the government rather than trying to correct the flaws of the market before the factprophylactically as he likes to sayshould wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust litigation to fix them he worked briefly at a corporate law firm and then became a protégé of joel klein the head of the antitrust division of the clinton justice department and the man who led the governments legal case against microsoft he was recently appointed chancellor of the new york publicschool system it testifies to powells political skill that he is probably the only high official in the bush administration who not only served in the clinton administration but also maintains close ties to bushs nemesis senator john mccain of arizona one of the things about powell that annoy people is his enduring love of law schoolits sort of like a lawschool study session over there one democratic former commissioner said as if to confirm the charge powell when i arrived introduced me to four law students summer interns at the commission whom hed invited to sit in i began by asking powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions of the fcc for example could private companies have apportioned the airwaves among themselves without the government being involved i think well never know powell said i dont think its an automatically bad idea the way some people will argue land is probably the best analogue we dont seize all the land in the united states and say the government will issue licenses to use land if my neighbor puts a fence one foot onto my property line theres a whole body of law about what i can do about that including whether i can tear it down if a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company its a similar proposition there are scholars who argueindeed the famous ronald coase treatise that won the nobel prize was about thisthat spectrum policy is lunacy the market could work this out in the kinds of ways that were accustomed to talking to powell was fun unlike most high government officials he doesnt seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding he slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs he speaks in ironic air quotes hes like your libertarian friend in college who enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he sees as sentimental or illogical after a while i asked him whether he thought his predecessors excitement about the telecommunications act had been excessive i would start with a caveat powell said look i cant fault those judgments in and of themselves given the time and what people thought they were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities but frankly ive always been a little bit critical first of all anybody who works with the act knows that it doesnt come anywhere close to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it by the president on down about the kinds of things its going to open up i mean i dont know what provisions are the informationsuperhighway provisions or what provisions are so digitally oriented or some of the things that were a big part of the theatre of its introduction when one starts reading the details one searches often in vain for these provisions but nonetheless there was a rising dotcom excitement and an internet excitement and people thought this was historic legislation and it certainly was but we were sucking helium out of balloons with the kinds of expectations that were being bandied around and this is before the economy or the market even gets in trouble it was a dramatically exaggerated expectationby the leadership of the commission by politicians by the market itself by companies themselves it was a gold rush and led to some very detrimental business decisions ones that government encouraged by its policies frankly everybody wanted to see numbers go up on the board powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the telecom act i want to see ten competitors twenty competitors i want to see thirtypercent market share fiftypercent market share i want the bells to bleed then well know weve succeeded now powell returned to being powell i think that expectation was astonishingly unrealistic in the short term they wanted to see it while theyre there we were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking and the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking theres no question we went too soon too fast too many companies took on too much debt too fast before the market really had a product or a business model how could the telecom act have been handled better we could have chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective and were slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system powell said money chased what seemed like governmentpromised opportunity the problem with that is theres a morning after and were in it and the problem is there is no short fix for this problem this debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level in some ways for shortterm gain we paid a price in longterm stability powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there had been a more reasonable level of investment no we wouldnt have every home in america with competitive choice yetbut we dont anyway i dont think its the remonopolization of telephone service i dont buy that the bells will prosper but did anybody believe they wouldnt the part of the story that didnt materialize was that people thought so would mci worldcom and sprint other local phone companies he added hadnt materialized as viable businesses either and they never might everybodys always saying the regulators did this and this and this but candidly the storys quite the opposite i think the regulators bent over backward for six years to give them a chance conditions dont get that good except once every thirty years and it didnt happen so whatever the reason were looking at a worldcom thats teetering were looking at a longdistance business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base at t is breaking itself up sprint has struggled could the fcc have done anything to make the longdistance companies stronger at the fcc i think ill just be blunt my political answer yes theres all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try to help but i cant find thirty billion dollars for worldcom somewhere i cant mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an sec investigation were i king it would be wonderful but i dont have those kinds of levers i dont know whether anybody does at some point companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from dying powell couldnt have made it much clearer that he doesnt think its his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash he has demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist gesturesin august for example five months after disbanding the fccs accounting safeguards division powell announced that he was appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the communications industry but that shows that powell is better at riding out the storm than say harvey pitt his counterpart at the securities and exchange commission and does not mean that he plans to try to shore up the telecom industry i asked powell if it would bother him if for most people only one company provided cable television and only one provided local phone service yes he said it concerns us that theres one of each of those things but lets not diminish the importance of there being one of each of those things that still is a nice suite of communications capabilities even if they arent direct analogues of each other anyway powell said before long the phone companies will be able to provide video service over their lines and the cable companies will provide data service over their lines so there will be more choice so yeah we have this anxiety we have one of everything the question is does it stay that way the concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of information did not appear to trouble powell either he said that people confuse bigness which brings many benefits with concentration which distorts markets if this were just economics its easy if you were to say to me mike just worry about economic concentration we know how to do thatthe econometrics of antitrust i can tell you when a markets too concentrated and prices are going to rise the problem is other dimensions like political ideological sometimes emotional take the question of if everybodys controlling what you see the assumption there is that somehow therell be this viewpoint a monolithic viewpoint pushed on you by your media and you wont get diversity i think thats a possibility i dont think its nearly the possibility thats ascribed to it sometimes powell explained sometimes when we see very pointed political or parochial programming it gets attacked as unfair i see some of the same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when rush limbaugh exists they love diversity but somehow we should run howard stern off the planet if it has a point of view then it becomes accused of bias and then we have policies likehere his tone went from ironic to sarcasticthe fairness doctrine which seems to me like the antithesis of what i thought those people cared about so when somebody is pointed and opinionated we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic fairness and integrity or whatever to make them balance it out fcc world abounds in theories about michael powell one is that he cant make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries he regulatesso he talks and talks and talks flamboyantly about the market in order to buy himself time another is that hes carrying water for the arbocks and the big cable companies another is that he is planning to run for the senate from virginia or to be appointed attorney general in a second bush term and doesnt want to do anything at the fcc that would diminish his chances another is that hes waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action so that he doesnt wind up going first and getting caught in the crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television networks in fcc world this is known as the powell doctrine of telecom after colin powells idea that the united states should never commit itself militarily without a clear objective overwhelming force and an exit strategy and another is that he actually believes what he says and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural healthy and irreversible and more concentration would be just fine this is why elections matter reed hundt who isnt happy about what has become of his telecom act told me its true that the fccmuch more than say the war in afghanistanis a case in which a gore administration would be acting quite differently from the bush administration consumers might have noticed the difference by now but theres no question whether communications companies have noticed the arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would have done if gore had won next election theyll help the party that helped them if the republicans win policy will tilt further in the arbocks favor if they lose perhaps the arbocks rivalsthe longdistance companies and the telecommunications upstartswith their friends now in power will stage a comeback americas present is not unrecognizably different from americas past

yahoo groups sponsor dvds free sp join now a new version of unison is now available for testing it incorporates several small improvements over but the main change is a fix to a bug that had potentially serious safety consequences but only for the very small number of users that are in the habit of running more than one instance of unison at a time in parallel these users are strongly encouraged to upgrade others can wait if they wish the release includes prebuilt executables for linux and solaris but not windows we are looking for a unisonwindows maintainer at the moment none of the active developers are regularly using unison on windows and we do not have a machine that is configured properly for building executables for export grab it from here enjoy benjamin changes since added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number of simultaneous file transfers added a backupdir preference which controls where backup files are stored basic support added for osx in particular unison now recognizes when one of the hosts being synchronized is running osx and switches to a caseinsensitive treatment of filenames ie foo and foo are considered to be the same file osx is not yet fully working however in particular files with resource forks will not be synchronized correctly the same hash used to form the archive name is now also added to the names of the temp files created during file transfer the reason for this is that during update detection we are going to silently delete any old temp files that we find along the way and we want to prevent ourselves from deleting temp files belonging to other instances of unison that may be running in parallel eg synchronizing with a different host thanks to ruslan ermilov for this suggestion several small user interface improvements documentation faq and bug reporting instructions have been split out as separate html pages accessible directly from the unison web page additions to faq in particular suggestions about performance tuning makefile makefileocaml now sets uistyletext or uistylegtk automatically depending on whether it finds lablgtk installed unison should now compile out of the box under osx changes since changing profile works again under windows file movement optimization unison now tries to use local copy instead of transfer for moved or copied files it is controled by a boolean option xferbycopying network statistics window transfer rate amount of data transferred nb not available in windowscygwin version symlinks work under the cygwin version which is dynamically linked fixed potential deadlock when synchronizing between windows and unix small improvements if neither the tt userprofile nor the tt home environment variables are set then unison will put its temporary commit log called tt dangerreadme into the directory named by the tt unison environment variable if any otherwise it will use tt c alternative set of values for fastcheck yes true no false default auto silent implies contactquietly source code code reorganization and tidying started breaking up some of the basic utility modules so that the nonunisonspecific stuff can be made available for other projects several makefile and docs changes for release further comments in updateml connection information is not stored in global variables anymore changes since small bugfix to textual user interface under unix to avoid leaving the terminal in a bad state where it would not echo inputs after unison exited changes since improvements to the main web page stable and beta version docs are now both accessible user manual revised added some new preferences sshcmd and rshcmd for specifying paths to ssh and rsh programs contactquietly for suppressing the contacting server message during unison startup under the graphical ui bug fixes fixed small bug in ui that neglected to change the displayed column headers if loading a new profile caused the roots to change fixed a bug that would put the text ui into an infinite loop if it encountered a conflict when run in batch mode added some code to try to fix the display of nonascii characters in filenames on windows systems in the gtk ui this code is currently untestedif youre one of the people that had reported problems with display of nonascii filenames wed appreciate knowing if this actually fixes things preferforce newer works properly now the bug was reported by sebastian urbaniak and sean fulton user interface and unison behavior renamed proceed to go in the graphical ui added exit status for the textual user interface paths that are not synchronized because of conflicts or errors during update detection are now noted in the log file end messages in log now use a briefer format changed the text ui startup sequence so that tt unison ui text will use the default profile instead of failing made some improvements to the error messages added some debugging messages to remoteml changes since incorporated once again a multithreaded transport subsystem it transfers several files at the same time thereby making much more effective use of available network bandwidth unlike the earlier attempt this time we do not rely on the native thread library of ocaml instead we implement a lightweight nonpreemptive multithread library in ocaml directly this version appears stable some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the multithreaded version these include in particular changes to the user interface and logging for example two log entries for each transferring task one for the beginning one for the end suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left by a previous unison run because warning does not work nicely under multithreading the temp file names are made less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by the user they take the form filenameserialunisontmp added a new command to the gtk user interface pressing f causes unison to start a new update detection phase using as paths just those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked as successfully completed use this command to quickly restart unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a previous run made the ignorecase preference uservisible and changed the initialization code so that it can be manually set to true even if neither host is running windows this may be useful eg when using unison running on a unix system with a fat volume mounted small improvements and bug fixes errors in preference files now generate fatal errors rather than warnings at startup time ie you cant go on from them also we fixed a bug that was preventing these warnings from appearing in the text ui so some users who have been running unsuspectingly with garbage in their prefs files may now get error reports error reporting for preference files now provides file name and line number more intelligible message in the case of identical change to the same files nothing to do replicas have been changed only in identical ways since last sync files with prefix excluded when scanning for preference files rsync instructions are send directly instead of first marshaled wont try forever to get the fingerprint of a continuously changing file unison will give up after certain number of retries other bug fixes including the one reported by peter selinger forceolder preference not working compilation upgraded to the new ocaml compiler with the lablgtk library patched version used for compiling under windows added the option to compile unison on the windows platform with cygwin gnu c compiler this option only supports building dynamically linked unison executables changes since fixed a silly but debilitating bug in the client startup sequence changes since added addprefsto preference which when set controls which preference file new preferences eg new ignore patterns are added to bug fix read the initial connection header one byte at a time so that we dont block if the header is shorter than expected this bug did not affect normal operation it just made it hard to tell when you were trying to use unison incorrectly with an old version of the server since it would hang instead of giving an error message changes since changed fastcheck from a boolean to a string preference its legal values are yes for a fast check no for a safe check or default for a fast checkwhich also happens to be safewhen running on unix and a safe check when on windows the default is default several preferences have been renamed for consistency all preference names are now spelled out in lowercase for backward compatibility the old names still work but they are not mentioned in the manual any more the temp files created by the diff and merge commands are now named by prepending a new prefix to the file name rather than appending a suffix this should avoid confusing diffmerge programs that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file contents we now set the keepalive option on the server socket to make sure that the server times out if the communication link is unexpectedly broken bug fixes when updating small files unison now closes the destination file file permissions are properly updated when the file is behind a followed link several other small fixes changes since major windows performance improvement weve added a preference fastcheck that makes unison look only at a files creation time and lastmodified time to check whether it has changed this should result in a huge speedup when checking for updates in large replicas when this switch is set unison will use file creation times as pseudo inode numbers when scanning windows replicas for updates instead of reading the full contents of every file this may cause unison to miss propagating an update if the create time modification time and length of the file are all unchanged by the update this is not easy to achieve but it can be done however unison will never overwrite such an update with a change from the other replica since it always does a safe check for updates just before propagating a change thus it is reasonable to use this switch most of the time and occasionally run unison once with fastcheck set to false if you are worried that unison may have overlooked an update warning this change is has not yet been thoroughly fieldtested if you set the fastcheck preference pay careful attention to what unison is doing new functionality centralized backups and merging this version incorporates two pieces of major new functionality implemented by sylvain roy during a summer internship at penn a centralized backup facility that keeps a full backup of selected files in each replica and a merging feature that allows unison to invoke an external filemerging tool to resolve conflicting changes to individual files centralized backups o unison now maintains full backups of the lastsynchronized versions of some of the files in each replica these function both as backups in the usual sense and as the common version when invoking external merge programs o the backed up files are stored in a directory unisonbackup on each host the name of this directory can be changed by setting the environment variable unisonbackupdir o the predicate backup controls which files are actually backed up giving the preference backup path causes backing up of all files o files are added to the backup directory whenever unison updates its archive this means that when unison reconstructs its archive from scratch eg because of an upgrade or because the archive files have been manually deleted all files will be backed up otherwise each file will be backed up the first time unison propagates an update for it o the preference backupversions controls how many previous versions of each file are kept the default is ie the last synchronized version plus one backup o for backward compatibility the backups preference is also still supported but backup is now preferred o it is ok to manually delete files from the backup directory or to throw away the directory itself before unison uses any of these files for anything important it checks that its fingerprint matches the one that it expects merging o both user interfaces offer a new merge command invoked by pressing m with a changed file selected o the actual merging is performed by an external program the preferences merge and merge control how this program is invoked if a backup exists for this file see the backup preference then the merge preference is used for this purpose otherwise merge is used in both cases the value of the preference should be a string representing the command that should be passed to a shell to invoke the merge program within this string the special substrings current current new and old may appear at any point unison will substitute these as follows before invoking the command current is replaced by the name of the local copy of the file current is replaced by the name of a temporary file into which the contents of the remote copy of the file have been transferred by unison prior to performing the merge new is replaced by the name of a temporary file that unison expects to be written by the merge program when it finishes giving the desired new contents of the file and old is replaced by the name of the backed up copy of the original version of the file ie its state at the end of the last successful run of unison if one exists applies only to merge not merge for example on unix systems setting the merge preference to merge diff m current old current new will tell unison to use the external diff program for merging a large number of external merging programs are available for example emacs users may find the following convenient merge emacs q eval ediffmergefiles current current nil new merge emacs q eval ediffmergefileswithancestor current current old nil new these commands are displayed here on two lines to avoid running off the edge of the page in your preference file each should be written on a single line o if the external program exits without leaving any file at the path new unison considers the merge to have failed if the merge program writes a file called new but exits with a nonzero status code then unison considers the merge to have succeeded but to have generated conflicts in this case it attempts to invoke an external editor so that the user can resolve the conflicts the value of the editor preference controls what editor is invoked by unison the default is emacs o please send us suggestions for other useful values of the merge and merge preferences wed like to give several examples in the manual smaller changes when one preference file includes another unison no longer adds the suffix prf to the included file by default if a file with precisely the given name exists in the unison directory it will be used otherwise unison will add prf as it did before this change means that included preference files can be named blahinclude instead of blahprf so that unison will not offer them in its choose a preference file dialog for linux systems we now offer both a statically linked and a dynamically linked executable the static one is larger but will probably run on more systems since it doesnt depend on the same versions of dynamically linked library modules being available fixed the force and prefer preferences which were getting the propagation direction exactly backwards fixed a bug in the startup code that would cause unison to crash when the default profile unisondefaultprf does not exist fixed a bug where on the run when a profile is first created unison would confusingly display the roots in reverse order in the user interface for developers weve added a module dependency diagram to the source distribution in srcdependenciesps to help new prospective developers with navigating the code changes since incompatible change archive format has changed incompatible change the startup sequence has been completely rewritten and greatly simplified the main uservisible change is that the defaultpath preference has been removed its effect can be approximated by using multiple profiles with include directives to incorporate common settings all uses of defaultpath in existing profiles should be changed to path another change in startup behavior that will affect some users is that it is no longer possible to specify roots both in the profile and on the command line you can achieve a similar effect though by breaking your profile into two defaultprf root blah root foo include common commonprf everything else now do unison common root root when you want to specify roots explicitly the prefer and force options have been extended to allow users to specify that files with more recent modtimes should be propagated writing either prefer newer or force newer for symmetry unison will also accept prefer older or force older the force oldernewer options can only be used when times is also set the graphical user interface provides access to these facilities on a oneoff basis via the actions menu names of roots can now be aliased to allow replicas to be relocated without changing the name of the archive file where unison stores information between runs this feature is for experts only see the archive files section of the manual for more information graphical userinterface a new command is provided in the synchronization menu for switching to a new profile without restarting unison from scratch the gui also supports onekey shortcuts for commonly used profiles if a profile contains a preference of the form key n where n is a single digit then pressing this key will cause unison to immediately switch to this profile and begin synchronization again from scratch any actions that may have been selected for a set of changes currently being displayed will be discarded each profile may include a preference label string giving a descriptive string that described the options selected in this profile the string is listed along with the profile name in the profile selection dialog and displayed in the topright corner of the main unison window minor fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the diff display to order the files backwards relative to the main user interface thanks to pascal brisset for this fix on unix systems the graphical version of unison will check the display variable and if it is not set automatically fall back to the textual user interface synchronization paths path preferences are now matched against the ignore preferences so if a path is both specified in a path preference and ignored it will be skipped numerous other bugfixes and small improvements changes since the synchronization of modification times has been disabled for directories preference files may now include lines of the form include name which will cause nameprf to be read at that point the synchronization of permission between windows and unix now works properly a binding cygwinbinmode in now added to the environment so that the cygwin port of openssh works properly in a noncygwin context the servercmd and addversionno preferences can now be used together addversionno appends an appropriate nnn to the server command which is found by using the value of the servercmd preference if there is one or else just unison both prefval and pref val are now allowed for boolean values the former can be used to set a preference to false lot of small bugs fixed changes since the log preference is now set to true by default since the log file seems useful for most users several miscellaneous bugfixes most involving symlinks changes since incompatible change archive format has changed again several significant bugs introduced in have been fixed changes since incompatible change archive format has changed make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading to avoid spurious conflicts the first sync after upgrading will be slow new functionality unison now synchronizes file modtimes userids and groupids these new features are controlled by a set of new preferences all of which are currently false by default o when the times preference is set to true file modification times are propaged because the representations of time may not have the same granularity on both replicas unison may not always be able to make the modtimes precisely equal but it will get them as close as the operating systems involved allow o when the owner preference is set to true file ownership information is synchronized o when the group preference is set to true group information is synchronized o when the numericids preference is set to true owner and group information is synchronized numerically by default owner and group numbers are converted to names on each replica and these names are synchronized the special user id and the special group are never mapped via usergroup names even if this preference is not set added an integervalued preference perms that can be used to control the propagation of permission bits the value of this preference is a mask indicating which permission bits should be synchronized it is set by default to o all bits but the setuid and setgid bits are synchronised synchronizing theses latter bits can be a security hazard if you want to synchronize all bits you can set the value of this preference to added a log preference default false which makes unison keep a complete record of the changes it makes to the replicas by default this record is written to a file called unisonlog in the users home directory the value of the home environment variable if you want it someplace else set the logfile preference to the full pathname you want unison to use added an ignorenot preference that maintains a set of patterns for paths that should definitely not be ignored whether or not they match an ignore pattern that is a path will now be ignored iff it matches an ignore pattern and does not match any ignorenot patterns userinterface improvements roots are now displayed in the user interface in the same order as they were given on the command line or in the preferences file when the batch preference is set the graphical user interface no longer waits for user confirmation when it displays a warning message it simply pops up an advisory window with a dismiss button at the bottom and keeps on going added a new preference for controlling how many status messages are printed during update detection statusdepth controls the maximum depth for paths on the local machine longer paths are not displayed nor are nondirectory paths the value should be an integer default is removed the trace and silent preferences they did not seem very useful and there were too many preferences for controlling output in various ways the text ui now displays just the default command the one that will be used if the user just types return instead of all available commands typing will print the full list of possibilities the function that finds the canonical hostname of the local host which is used for example in calculating the name of the archive file used to remember which files have been synchronized normally uses the gethostname operating system call however if the environment variable unisonlocalhostname is set its value will now be used instead this makes it easier to use unison in situations where a machines name changes frequently eg because it is a laptop and gets moved around a lot file owner and group are now displayed in the detail window at the bottom of the screen when unison is configured to synchronize them for hackers updated to jacques garrigues new version of lablgtk which means we can throw away our local patched version if youre compiling the gtk version of unison from sources youll need to update your copy of lablgtk to the developers release available from warning installing lablgtk under windows is currently a bit challenging the todotxt file in the source distribution has been cleaned up and reorganized the list of pending tasks should be much easier to make sense of for people that may want to contribute their programming energies there is also a separate file bugstxt for open bugs the tk user interface has been removed it was not being maintained and no longer compiles the debug preference now prints quite a bit of additional information that should be useful for identifying sources of problems the version number of the remote server is now checked right away during the connection setup handshake rather than later somebody sent a bug report of a server crash that turned out to come from using inconsistent versions better to check this earlier and in a way that cant crash either client or server unison now runs correctly on bit architectures eg alpha linux we will not be distributing binaries for these architectures ourselves at least for a while but if someone would like to make them available well be glad to provide a link to them bug fixes pattern matching eg for ignore is now caseinsensitive when unison is in caseinsensitive mode ie when one of the replicas is on a windows machine some people had trouble with mysterious failures during propagation of updates where files would be falsely reported as having changed during synchronization this should be fixed numerous smaller fixes changes since added a number of sorting modes for the user interface by default conflicting changes are displayed at the top and the rest of the entries are sorted in alphabetical order this behavior can be changed in the following ways setting the sortnewfirst preference to true causes newly created files to be displayed before changed files setting sortbysize causes files to be displayed in increasing order of size giving the preference sortfirstpattern where pattern is a path descriptor in the same format as ignore and follow patterns causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed first similarly giving the preference sortlastpattern causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed last the sorting preferences are described in more detail in the user manual the sortnewfirst and sortbysize flags can also be accessed from the sort menu in the grpahical user interface added two new preferences that can be used to change unisons fundamental behavior to make it more like a mirroring tool instead of a synchronizer giving the preference prefer with argument root by adding prefer root to the command line or preferroot to your profile means that if there is a conflict the contents of root should be propagated to the other replica with no questions asked nonconflicting changes are treated as usual giving the preference force with argument root will make unison resolve all differences in favor of the given root even if it was the other replica that was changed these options should be used with care more information is available in the manual small changes changed default answer to yes in all twobutton dialogs in the graphical interface this seems more intuitive the rsync preference has been removed it was used to activate rsync compression for file transfers but rsync compression is now enabled by default in the text user interface the arrows indicating which direction changes are being propagated are printed differently when the user has overridded unisons default recommendation instead of this matches the behavior of the graphical interface which displays such arrows in a different color carriage returns controlms are ignored at the ends of lines in profiles for windows compatibility all preferences are now fully documented in the user manual changes since incompatible change archive format has changed make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading to avoid spurious conflicts the first sync after upgrading will be slow newimproved functionality a new preference sortbysize controls the order in which changes are displayed to the user when it is set to true the smallest changed files are displayed first the default setting is false a new preference sortnewfirst causes newly created files to be listed before other updates in the user interface we now allow the ssh protocol to specify a port incompatible change the unison protocol is deprecated and we added file and socket you may have to modify your profiles in the unison directory if a replica is specified without an explicit protocol we now assume it refers to a file previously saulfoo meant to use ssh to connect to saul then access the foo directory now it means to access saul via a remote file mechanism such as samba the old effect is now achieved by writing sshsaulfoo changed the startup sequence for the case where roots are given but no profile is given on the command line the new behavior is to use the default profile creating it if it does not exist and temporarily override its roots the manual claimed that this case would work by reading no profile at all but afaik this was never true in all user interfaces files with conflicts are always listed first a new preference sshversion can be used to control which version of ssh should be used to connect to the server legal values are and default is empty which will make unison use whatever version of ssh is installed as the default ssh command the situation when the permissions of a file was updated the same on both side is now handled correctly we used to report a spurious conflict improvements for the windows version the fact that filenames are treated caseinsensitively under windows should now be handled correctly the exact behavior is described in the crossplatform section of the manual it should be possible to synchronize with windows shares eg hostdrivepath workarounds to the bug in syncing root directories in windows the most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml bug unixopendir fails on c in some versions of windows improvements to the gtk user interface the tk interface is no longer being maintained the ui now displays actions differently in blue when they have been explicitly changed by the user from unisons default recommendation more colorful appearance the initial profile selection window works better if any transfers failed a message to this effect is displayed along with synchronization complete at the end of the transfer phase in case they may have scrolled off the top added a global progress meter displaying the percentage of total bytes that have been transferred so far improvements to the text user interface the file details will be displayed automatically when a conflict is been detected when a warning is generated eg for a temporary file left over from a previous run of unison unison will no longer wait for a response if it is running in batch mode the ui now displays a short list of possible inputs each time it waits for user interaction the ui now quits immediately rather than looping back and starting the interaction again if the user presses q when asked whether to propagate changes pressing g in the text user interface will proceed immediately with propagating updates without asking any more questions documentation and installation changes the manual now includes a faq plus sections on common problems and on tricks contributed by users both the download page and the download directory explicitly say what are the current stable and betatest version numbers the ocaml sources for the uptotheminute developers version not guaranteed to be stable or even to compile at any given time are now available from the download page added a subsection to the manual describing crossplatform issues case conflicts illegal filenames many small bug fixes and random improvements changes since several bug fixes the most important is a bug in the rsync module that would occasionally cause change propagation to fail with a rename error changes since the multithreaded transport system is now disabled by default it is not stable enough yet various bug fixes a new experimental feature the final component of a path argument may now be the wildcard specifier when unison sees such a path it expands this path on the client into into the corresponding list of paths by listing the contents of that directory note that if you use wildcard paths from the command line you will probably need to use quotes or a backslash to prevent the from being interpreted by your shell if both roots are local the contents of the first one will be used for expanding wildcard paths nb this is the first one after the canonization step ie the one that is listed first in the user interface not the one listed first on the command line or in the preferences file changes since the transport subsystem now includes an implementation by sylvain gommier and norman ramsey of tridgell and mackerrass rsync protocol this protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs this feature is mainly helpful for transfers over slow linkson fast local area networks it can actually degrade performanceso we have left it off by default start unison with the rsync option or put rsynctrue in your preferences file to turn it on progress bars are now diplayed during remote file transfers showing what percentage of each file has been transferred so far the version numbering scheme has changed new releases will now be have numbers like where the second component is incremented on every significant public release and the third component is the patch level miscellaneous improvements to the gtkbased user interface the manual is now available in pdf format we are experimenting with using a multithreaded transport subsystem to transfer several files at the same time making much more effective use of available network bandwidth this feature is not completely stable yet so by default it is disabled in the release version of unison if you want to play with the multithreaded version youll need to recompile unison from sources as described in the documentation setting the threads flag in makefileocaml to true make sure that your ocaml compiler has been installed with the withpthreads configuration option you can verify this by checking whether the file threadsthreadscma in the ocaml standard library directory contains the string lpthread near the end changes since reduced memory footprint this is especially important during the first run of unison where it has to gather information about all the files in both repositories fixed a bug that would cause the socket server under nt to fail after the client exits added a shift modifier to the ignore menu shortcut keys in gtk interface to avoid hitting them accidentally changes since tunneling over ssh is now supported in the windows version see the installation section of the manual for detailed instructions the transport subsystem now includes an implementation of the rsync protocol built by sylvain gommier and norman ramsey this protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs the rsync feature is off by default in the current version use the rsync switch to turn it on nb we still have a lot of tuning to do you may not notice much speedup yet were experimenting with a multithreaded transport subsystem written by jerome vouillon the downloadable binaries are still singlethreaded if you want to try the multithreaded version youll need to recompile from sources say make threadstrue native thread support from the compiler is required use the option threads n to select the maximal number of concurrent threads default is multithreaded and singlethreaded clientsservers can interoperate a new gtkbased user interface is now available thanks to jacques garrigue the tk user interface still works but well be shifting development effort to the gtk interface from now on ocaml is now required for compiling unison from sources the modules uitk and myfileselect have been changed to use labltk instead of camltk to compile the tk interface in windows you must have ocaml and tk when installing tk put it in ctcl rather than the suggested cprogram filestcl and be sure to install the headers and libraries which are not installed by default added a new addversionno switch which causes unison to use unisoncurrentversionnumber instead of just unison as the remote server command this allows multiple versions of unison to coexist conveniently on the same server whichever version is run on the client the same version will be selected on the server changes since incompatible change archive format has changed make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading to avoid spurious conflicts the first sync after upgrading will be slow this version fixes several annoying bugs including some cases where propagation of file permissions was not working umask is now ignored when creating directories directories are create writable so that a readonly directory and its contents can be propagated handling of warnings generated by the server synchronizing a path whose parent is not a directory on both sides is now flagged as erroneous fixed some bugs related to symnbolic links and nonexistant roots o when a change deletion or new contents is propagated onto a followed symlink the file pointed to by the link is now changed we used to change the link itself which doesnt fit our assertion that follow means the link is completely invisible o when one root did not exist propagating the other root on top of it used to fail becuase unison could not calculate the working directory into which to write changes this should be fixed a humanreadable timestamp has been added to unisons archive files the semantics of path and name regular expressions now correspond better some minor improvements to the text ui eg a command for going back to previous items the organization of the export directory has changed should be easier to find download things now changes since incompatible change archive format has changed make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading to avoid spurious conflicts the first sync after upgrading will be slow this version has not been tested extensively on windows major internal changes designed to make unison safer to run at the same time as the replicas are being changed by the user internal performance improvements changes since incompatible change archive format has changed make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading to avoid spurious conflicts the first sync after upgrading will be slow a number of internal functions have been changed to reduce the amount of memory allocation especially during the first synchronization this should help power users with very big replicas reimplementation of lowlevel remote procedure call stuff in preparation for adding rsynclike smart file transfer in a later release miscellaneous bug fixes changes since incompatible change archive format has changed make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading to avoid spurious conflicts the first sync after upgrading will be slow fixed some small bugs in the interpretation of ignore patterns fixed some problems that were preventing the windows version from working correctly when clickstarted fixes to treatment of file permissions under windows which were causing spurious reports of different permissions when synchronizing between windows and unix systems fixed one more nontailrecursive list processing function which was causing stack overflows when synchronizing very large replicas changes since the text user interface now provides commands for ignoring files we found and fixed some more nontailrecursive list processing functions some power users have reported success with very large replicas incompatible change files ending in tmp are no longer ignored automatically if you want to ignore such files put an appropriate ignore pattern in your profile incompatible change the syntax of ignore and follow patterns has changed instead of putting a line of the form ignore regexp in your profile unisondefaultprf you should put ignore regexp regexp moreover two other styles of pattern are also recognized ignore name name matches any path in which one component matches name while ignore path path matches exactly the path path standard globbing conventions can be used in name and path a matches any single character except a matches any sequence of characters not including xyz matches any character from the set x y z abbccc matches any one of a bb or ccc see the user manual for some examples changes since some users were reporting stack overflows when synchronizing huge directories we found and fixed some nontailrecursive list processing functions which we hope will solve the problem please give it a try and let us know major additions to the documentation changes since major internal tidying and many small bugfixes major additions to the user manual unison can now be started with no arguments it will prompt automatically for the name of a profile file containing the roots to be synchronized this makes it possible to start the graphical ui from a desktop icon fixed a small bug where the text ui on nt was raising a no such signal exception changes since the precompiled windows binary in the last release was compiled with an old ocaml compiler causing propagation of permissions not to work and perhaps leading to some other strange behaviors weve heard reports about this has been corrected if youre using precompiled binaries on windows please upgrade added a debug command line flag which controls debugging of various modules say debug xxx to enable debug tracing for module xxx or debug all to turn on absolutely everything fixed a small bug where the text ui on nt was raising a no such signal exception changes since incompatible change the names and formats of the preference files in the unison directory have changed in particular the file prefs should be renamed to defaultprf the contents of the file ignore should be merged into defaultprf each line of the form regexp in ignore should become a line of the form ignore regexp in defaultprf unison now handles permission bits and symbolic links see the manual for details you can now have different preference files in your unison directory if you start unison like this unison profilename ie with just one anonymous commandline argument then the file unisonprofilenameprf will be loaded instead of defaultprf some improvements to terminal handling in the text user interface added a switch killserver that terminates the remote server process when the unison client is shutting down even when using sockets for communication by default a remote server created using sshrsh is terminated automatically while a socket server is left running when started in socket server mode unison prints server started on stderr when it is ready to accept connections this may be useful for scripts that want to tell when a socketmode server has finished initalization we now make a nightly mirror of our current internal development tree in case anyone wants an uptotheminute version to hack around with added a file contrib with some suggestions for how to help us make unison better changes in version changes since added a preference maxthreads that can be used to limit the number of simultaneous file transfers added a backupdir preference which controls where backup files are stored basic support added for osx in particular unison now recognizes when one of the hosts being synchronized is running osx and switches to a caseinsensitive treatment of filenames ie foo and foo are considered to be the same file osx is not yet fully working however in particular files with resource forks will not be synchronized correctly the same hash used to form the archive name is now also added to the names of the temp files created during file transfer the reason for this is that during update detection we are going to silently delete any old temp files that we find along the way and we want to prevent ourselves from deleting temp files belonging to other instances of unison that may be running in parallel eg synchronizing with a different host thanks to ruslan ermilov for this suggestion several small user interface improvements documentation faq and bug reporting instructions have been split out as separate html pages accessible directly from the unison web page additions to faq in particular suggestions about performance tuning makefile makefileocaml now sets uistyletext or uistylegtk automatically depending on whether it finds lablgtk installed unison should now compile out of the box under osx changes since changing profile works again under windows file movement optimization unison now tries to use local copy instead of transfer for moved or copied files it is controled by a boolean option xferbycopying network statistics window transfer rate amount of data transferred nb not available in windowscygwin version symlinks work under the cygwin version which is dynamically linked fixed potential deadlock when synchronizing between windows and unix small improvements if neither the tt userprofile nor the tt home environment variables are set then unison will put its temporary commit log called tt dangerreadme into the directory named by the tt unison environment variable if any otherwise it will use tt c alternative set of values for fastcheck yes true no false default auto silent implies contactquietly source code code reorganization and tidying started breaking up some of the basic utility modules so that the nonunisonspecific stuff can be made available for other projects several makefile and docs changes for release further comments in updateml connection information is not stored in global variables anymore changes since small bugfix to textual user interface under unix to avoid leaving the terminal in a bad state where it would not echo inputs after unison exited changes since improvements to the main web page stable and beta version docs are now both accessible user manual revised added some new preferences sshcmd and rshcmd for specifying paths to ssh and rsh programs contactquietly for suppressing the contacting server message during unison startup under the graphical ui bug fixes fixed small bug in ui that neglected to change the displayed column headers if loading a new profile caused the roots to change fixed a bug that would put the text ui into an infinite loop if it encountered a conflict when run in batch mode added some code to try to fix the display of nonascii characters in filenames on windows systems in the gtk ui this code is currently untestedif youre one of the people that had reported problems with display of nonascii filenames wed appreciate knowing if this actually fixes things preferforce newer works properly now the bug was reported by sebastian urbaniak and sean fulton user interface and unison behavior renamed proceed to go in the graphical ui added exit status for the textual user interface paths that are not synchronized because of conflicts or errors during update detection are now noted in the log file end messages in log now use a briefer format changed the text ui startup sequence so that tt unison ui text will use the default profile instead of failing made some improvements to the error messages added some debugging messages to remoteml changes since incorporated once again a multithreaded transport subsystem it transfers several files at the same time thereby making much more effective use of available network bandwidth unlike the earlier attempt this time we do not rely on the native thread library of ocaml instead we implement a lightweight nonpreemptive multithread library in ocaml directly this version appears stable some adjustments to unison are made to accommodate the multithreaded version these include in particular changes to the user interface and logging for example two log entries for each transferring task one for the beginning one for the end suppressed warning messages against removing temp files left by a previous unison run because warning does not work nicely under multithreading the temp file names are made less likely to coincide with the name of a file created by the user they take the form filenameserialunisontmp added a new command to the gtk user interface pressing f causes unison to start a new update detection phase using as paths just those paths that have been detected as changed and not yet marked as successfully completed use this command to quickly restart unison on just the set of paths still needing attention after a previous run made the ignorecase preference uservisible and changed the initialization code so that it can be manually set to true even if neither host is running windows this may be useful eg when using unison running on a unix system with a fat volume mounted small improvements and bug fixes errors in preference files now generate fatal errors rather than warnings at startup time ie you cant go on from them also we fixed a bug that was preventing these warnings from appearing in the text ui so some users who have been running unsuspectingly with garbage in their prefs files may now get error reports error reporting for preference files now provides file name and line number more intelligible message in the case of identical change to the same files nothing to do replicas have been changed only in identical ways since last sync files with prefix excluded when scanning for preference files rsync instructions are send directly instead of first marshaled wont try forever to get the fingerprint of a continuously changing file unison will give up after certain number of retries other bug fixes including the one reported by peter selinger forceolder preference not working compilation upgraded to the new ocaml compiler with the lablgtk library patched version used for compiling under windows added the option to compile unison on the windows platform with cygwin gnu c compiler this option only supports building dynamically linked unison executables changes since fixed a silly but debilitating bug in the client startup sequence changes since added addprefsto preference which when set controls which preference file new preferences eg new ignore patterns are added to bug fix read the initial connection header one byte at a time so that we dont block if the header is shorter than expected this bug did not affect normal operation it just made it hard to tell when you were trying to use unison incorrectly with an old version of the server since it would hang instead of giving an error message changes since changed fastcheck from a boolean to a string preference its legal values are yes for a fast check no for a safe check or default for a fast checkwhich also happens to be safewhen running on unix and a safe check when on windows the default is default several preferences have been renamed for consistency all preference names are now spelled out in lowercase for backward compatibility the old names still work but they are not mentioned in the manual any more the temp files created by the diff and merge commands are now named by prepending a new prefix to the file name rather than appending a suffix this should avoid confusing diffmerge programs that depend on the suffix to guess the type of the file contents we now set the keepalive option on the server socket to make sure that the server times out if the communication link is unexpectedly broken bug fixes when updating small files unison now closes the destination file file permissions are properly updated when the file is behind a followed link several other small fixes changes since major windows performance improvement weve added a preference fastcheck that makes unison look only at a files creation time and lastmodified time to check whether it has changed this should result in a huge speedup when checking for updates in large replicas when this switch is set unison will use file creation times as pseudo inode numbers when scanning windows replicas for updates instead of reading the full contents of every file this may cause unison to miss propagating an update if the create time modification time and length of the file are all unchanged by the update this is not easy to achieve but it can be done however unison will never overwrite such an update with a change from the other replica since it always does a safe check for updates just before propagating a change thus it is reasonable to use this switch most of the time and occasionally run unison once with fastcheck set to false if you are worried that unison may have overlooked an update warning this change is has not yet been thoroughly fieldtested if you set the fastcheck preference pay careful attention to what unison is doing new functionality centralized backups and merging this version incorporates two pieces of major new functionality implemented by sylvain roy during a summer internship at penn a centralized backup facility that keeps a full backup of selected files in each replica and a merging feature that allows unison to invoke an external filemerging tool to resolve conflicting changes to individual files centralized backups o unison now maintains full backups of the lastsynchronized versions of some of the files in each replica these function both as backups in the usual sense and as the common version when invoking external merge programs o the backed up files are stored in a directory unisonbackup on each host the name of this directory can be changed by setting the environment variable unisonbackupdir o the predicate backup controls which files are actually backed up giving the preference backup path causes backing up of all files o files are added to the backup directory whenever unison updates its archive this means that when unison reconstructs its archive from scratch eg because of an upgrade or because the archive files have been manually deleted all files will be backed up otherwise each file will be backed up the first time unison propagates an update for it o the preference backupversions controls how many previous versions of each file are kept the default is ie the last synchronized version plus one backup o for backward compatibility the backups preference is also still supported but backup is now preferred o it is ok to manually delete files from the backup directory or to throw away the directory itself before unison uses any of these files for anything important it checks that its fingerprint matches the one that it expects merging o both user interfaces offer a new merge command invoked by pressing m with a changed file selected o the actual merging is performed by an external program the preferences merge and merge control how this program is invoked if a backup exists for this file see the backup preference then the merge preference is used for this purpose otherwise merge is used in both cases the value of the preference should be a string representing the command that should be passed to a shell to invoke the merge program within this string the special substrings current current new and old may appear at any point unison will substitute these as follows before invoking the command current is replaced by the name of the local copy of the file current is replaced by the name of a temporary file into which the contents of the remote copy of the file have been transferred by unison prior to performing the merge new is replaced by the name of a temporary file that unison expects to be written by the merge program when it finishes giving the desired new contents of the file and old is replaced by the name of the backed up copy of the original version of the file ie its state at the end of the last successful run of unison if one exists applies only to merge not merge for example on unix systems setting the merge preference to merge diff m current old current new will tell unison to use the external diff program for merging a large number of external merging programs are available for example emacs users may find the following convenient merge emacs q eval ediffmergefiles current current nil new merge emacs q eval ediffmergefileswithancestor current current old nil new these commands are displayed here on two lines to avoid running off the edge of the page in your preference file each should be written on a single line o if the external program exits without leaving any file at the path new unison considers the merge to have failed if the merge program writes a file called new but exits with a nonzero status code then unison considers the merge to have succeeded but to have generated conflicts in this case it attempts to invoke an external editor so that the user can resolve the conflicts the value of the editor preference controls what editor is invoked by unison the default is emacs o please send us suggestions for other useful values of the merge and merge preferences wed like to give several examples in the manual smaller changes when one preference file includes another unison no longer adds the suffix prf to the included file by default if a file with precisely the given name exists in the unison directory it will be used otherwise unison will add prf as it did before this change means that included preference files can be named blahinclude instead of blahprf so that unison will not offer them in its choose a preference file dialog for linux systems we now offer both a statically linked and a dynamically linked executable the static one is larger but will probably run on more systems since it doesnt depend on the same versions of dynamically linked library modules being available fixed the force and prefer preferences which were getting the propagation direction exactly backwards fixed a bug in the startup code that would cause unison to crash when the default profile unisondefaultprf does not exist fixed a bug where on the run when a profile is first created unison would confusingly display the roots in reverse order in the user interface for developers weve added a module dependency diagram to the source distribution in srcdependenciesps to help new prospective developers with navigating the code changes since incompatible change archive format has changed incompatible change the startup sequence has been completely rewritten and greatly simplified the main uservisible change is that the defaultpath preference has been removed its effect can be approximated by using multiple profiles with include directives to incorporate common settings all uses of defaultpath in existing profiles should be changed to path another change in startup behavior that will affect some users is that it is no longer possible to specify roots both in the profile and on the command line you can achieve a similar effect though by breaking your profile into two defaultprf root blah root foo include common commonprf everything else now do unison common root root when you want to specify roots explicitly the prefer and force options have been extended to allow users to specify that files with more recent modtimes should be propagated writing either prefer newer or force newer for symmetry unison will also accept prefer older or force older the force oldernewer options can only be used when times is also set the graphical user interface provides access to these facilities on a oneoff basis via the actions menu names of roots can now be aliased to allow replicas to be relocated without changing the name of the archive file where unison stores information between runs this feature is for experts only see the archive files section of the manual for more information graphical userinterface a new command is provided in the synchronization menu for switching to a new profile without restarting unison from scratch the gui also supports onekey shortcuts for commonly used profiles if a profile contains a preference of the form key n where n is a single digit then pressing this key will cause unison to immediately switch to this profile and begin synchronization again from scratch any actions that may have been selected for a set of changes currently being displayed will be discarded each profile may include a preference label string giving a descriptive string that described the options selected in this profile the string is listed along with the profile name in the profile selection dialog and displayed in the topright corner of the main unison window minor fixed a bug that would sometimes cause the diff display to order the files backwards relative to the main user interface thanks to pascal brisset for this fix on unix systems the graphical version of unison will check the display variable and if it is not set automatically fall back to the textual user interface synchronization paths path preferences are now matched against the ignore preferences so if a path is both specified in a path preference and ignored it will be skipped numerous other bugfixes and small improvements changes since the synchronization of modification times has been disabled for directories preference files may now include lines of the form include name which will cause nameprf to be read at that point the synchronization of permission between windows and unix now works properly a binding cygwinbinmode in now added to the environment so that the cygwin port of openssh works properly in a noncygwin context the servercmd and addversionno preferences can now be used together addversionno appends an appropriate nnn to the server command which is found by using the value of the servercmd preference if there is one or else just unison both prefval and pref val are now allowed for boolean values the former can be used to set a preference to false lot of small bugs fixed changes since the log preference is now set to true by default since the log file seems useful for most users several miscellaneous bugfixes most involving symlinks changes since incompatible change archive format has changed again several significant bugs introduced in have been fixed changes since incompatible change archive format has changed make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading to avoid spurious conflicts the first sync after upgrading will be slow new functionality unison now synchronizes file modtimes userids and groupids these new features are controlled by a set of new preferences all of which are currently false by default o when the times preference is set to true file modification times are propaged because the representations of time may not have the same granularity on both replicas unison may not always be able to make the modtimes precisely equal but it will get them as close as the operating systems involved allow o when the owner preference is set to true file ownership information is synchronized o when the group preference is set to true group information is synchronized o when the numericids preference is set to true owner and group information is synchronized numerically by default owner and group numbers are converted to names on each replica and these names are synchronized the special user id and the special group are never mapped via usergroup names even if this preference is not set added an integervalued preference perms that can be used to control the propagation of permission bits the value of this preference is a mask indicating which permission bits should be synchronized it is set by default to o all bits but the setuid and setgid bits are synchronised synchronizing theses latter bits can be a security hazard if you want to synchronize all bits you can set the value of this preference to added a log preference default false which makes unison keep a complete record of the changes it makes to the replicas by default this record is written to a file called unisonlog in the users home directory the value of the home environment variable if you want it someplace else set the logfile preference to the full pathname you want unison to use added an ignorenot preference that maintains a set of patterns for paths that should definitely not be ignored whether or not they match an ignore pattern that is a path will now be ignored iff it matches an ignore pattern and does not match any ignorenot patterns userinterface improvements roots are now displayed in the user interface in the same order as they were given on the command line or in the preferences file when the batch preference is set the graphical user interface no longer waits for user confirmation when it displays a warning message it simply pops up an advisory window with a dismiss button at the bottom and keeps on going added a new preference for controlling how many status messages are printed during update detection statusdepth controls the maximum depth for paths on the local machine longer paths are not displayed nor are nondirectory paths the value should be an integer default is removed the trace and silent preferences they did not seem very useful and there were too many preferences for controlling output in various ways the text ui now displays just the default command the one that will be used if the user just types return instead of all available commands typing will print the full list of possibilities the function that finds the canonical hostname of the local host which is used for example in calculating the name of the archive file used to remember which files have been synchronized normally uses the gethostname operating system call however if the environment variable unisonlocalhostname is set its value will now be used instead this makes it easier to use unison in situations where a machines name changes frequently eg because it is a laptop and gets moved around a lot file owner and group are now displayed in the detail window at the bottom of the screen when unison is configured to synchronize them for hackers updated to jacques garrigues new version of lablgtk which means we can throw away our local patched version if youre compiling the gtk version of unison from sources youll need to update your copy of lablgtk to the developers release available from warning installing lablgtk under windows is currently a bit challenging the todotxt file in the source distribution has been cleaned up and reorganized the list of pending tasks should be much easier to make sense of for people that may want to contribute their programming energies there is also a separate file bugstxt for open bugs the tk user interface has been removed it was not being maintained and no longer compiles the debug preference now prints quite a bit of additional information that should be useful for identifying sources of problems the version number of the remote server is now checked right away during the connection setup handshake rather than later somebody sent a bug report of a server crash that turned out to come from using inconsistent versions better to check this earlier and in a way that cant crash either client or server unison now runs correctly on bit architectures eg alpha linux we will not be distributing binaries for these architectures ourselves at least for a while but if someone would like to make them available well be glad to provide a link to them bug fixes pattern matching eg for ignore is now caseinsensitive when unison is in caseinsensitive mode ie when one of the replicas is on a windows machine some people had trouble with mysterious failures during propagation of updates where files would be falsely reported as having changed during synchronization this should be fixed numerous smaller fixes changes since added a number of sorting modes for the user interface by default conflicting changes are displayed at the top and the rest of the entries are sorted in alphabetical order this behavior can be changed in the following ways setting the sortnewfirst preference to true causes newly created files to be displayed before changed files setting sortbysize causes files to be displayed in increasing order of size giving the preference sortfirstpattern where pattern is a path descriptor in the same format as ignore and follow patterns causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed first similarly giving the preference sortlastpattern causes paths matching this pattern to be displayed last the sorting preferences are described in more detail in the user manual the sortnewfirst and sortbysize flags can also be accessed from the sort menu in the grpahical user interface added two new preferences that can be used to change unisons fundamental behavior to make it more like a mirroring tool instead of a synchronizer giving the preference prefer with argument root by adding prefer root to the command line or preferroot to your profile means that if there is a conflict the contents of root should be propagated to the other replica with no questions asked nonconflicting changes are treated as usual giving the preference force with argument root will make unison resolve all differences in favor of the given root even if it was the other replica that was changed these options should be used with care more information is available in the manual small changes changed default answer to yes in all twobutton dialogs in the graphical interface this seems more intuitive the rsync preference has been removed it was used to activate rsync compression for file transfers but rsync compression is now enabled by default in the text user interface the arrows indicating which direction changes are being propagated are printed differently when the user has overridded unisons default recommendation instead of this matches the behavior of the graphical interface which displays such arrows in a different color carriage returns controlms are ignored at the ends of lines in profiles for windows compatibility all preferences are now fully documented in the user manual changes since incompatible change archive format has changed make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading to avoid spurious conflicts the first sync after upgrading will be slow newimproved functionality a new preference sortbysize controls the order in which changes are displayed to the user when it is set to true the smallest changed files are displayed first the default setting is false a new preference sortnewfirst causes newly created files to be listed before other updates in the user interface we now allow the ssh protocol to specify a port incompatible change the unison protocol is deprecated and we added file and socket you may have to modify your profiles in the unison directory if a replica is specified without an explicit protocol we now assume it refers to a file previously saulfoo meant to use ssh to connect to saul then access the foo directory now it means to access saul via a remote file mechanism such as samba the old effect is now achieved by writing sshsaulfoo changed the startup sequence for the case where roots are given but no profile is given on the command line the new behavior is to use the default profile creating it if it does not exist and temporarily override its roots the manual claimed that this case would work by reading no profile at all but afaik this was never true in all user interfaces files with conflicts are always listed first a new preference sshversion can be used to control which version of ssh should be used to connect to the server legal values are and default is empty which will make unison use whatever version of ssh is installed as the default ssh command the situation when the permissions of a file was updated the same on both side is now handled correctly we used to report a spurious conflict improvements for the windows version the fact that filenames are treated caseinsensitively under windows should now be handled correctly the exact behavior is described in the crossplatform section of the manual it should be possible to synchronize with windows shares eg hostdrivepath workarounds to the bug in syncing root directories in windows the most difficult thing to fix is an ocaml bug unixopendir fails on c in some versions of windows improvements to the gtk user interface the tk interface is no longer being maintained the ui now displays actions differently in blue when they have been explicitly changed by the user from unisons default recommendation more colorful appearance the initial profile selection window works better if any transfers failed a message to this effect is displayed along with synchronization complete at the end of the transfer phase in case they may have scrolled off the top added a global progress meter displaying the percentage of total bytes that have been transferred so far improvements to the text user interface the file details will be displayed automatically when a conflict is been detected when a warning is generated eg for a temporary file left over from a previous run of unison unison will no longer wait for a response if it is running in batch mode the ui now displays a short list of possible inputs each time it waits for user interaction the ui now quits immediately rather than looping back and starting the interaction again if the user presses q when asked whether to propagate changes pressing g in the text user interface will proceed immediately with propagating updates without asking any more questions documentation and installation changes the manual now includes a faq plus sections on common problems and on tricks contributed by users both the download page and the download directory explicitly say what are the current stable and betatest version numbers the ocaml sources for the uptotheminute developers version not guaranteed to be stable or even to compile at any given time are now available from the download page added a subsection to the manual describing crossplatform issues case conflicts illegal filenames many small bug fixes and random improvements changes since several bug fixes the most important is a bug in the rsync module that would occasionally cause change propagation to fail with a rename error changes since the multithreaded transport system is now disabled by default it is not stable enough yet various bug fixes a new experimental feature the final component of a path argument may now be the wildcard specifier when unison sees such a path it expands this path on the client into into the corresponding list of paths by listing the contents of that directory note that if you use wildcard paths from the command line you will probably need to use quotes or a backslash to prevent the from being interpreted by your shell if both roots are local the contents of the first one will be used for expanding wildcard paths nb this is the first one after the canonization step ie the one that is listed first in the user interface not the one listed first on the command line or in the preferences file changes since the transport subsystem now includes an implementation by sylvain gommier and norman ramsey of tridgell and mackerrass rsync protocol this protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs this feature is mainly helpful for transfers over slow linkson fast local area networks it can actually degrade performanceso we have left it off by default start unison with the rsync option or put rsynctrue in your preferences file to turn it on progress bars are now diplayed during remote file transfers showing what percentage of each file has been transferred so far the version numbering scheme has changed new releases will now be have numbers like where the second component is incremented on every significant public release and the third component is the patch level miscellaneous improvements to the gtkbased user interface the manual is now available in pdf format we are experimenting with using a multithreaded transport subsystem to transfer several files at the same time making much more effective use of available network bandwidth this feature is not completely stable yet so by default it is disabled in the release version of unison if you want to play with the multithreaded version youll need to recompile unison from sources as described in the documentation setting the threads flag in makefileocaml to true make sure that your ocaml compiler has been installed with the withpthreads configuration option you can verify this by checking whether the file threadsthreadscma in the ocaml standard library directory contains the string lpthread near the end changes since reduced memory footprint this is especially important during the first run of unison where it has to gather information about all the files in both repositories fixed a bug that would cause the socket server under nt to fail after the client exits added a shift modifier to the ignore menu shortcut keys in gtk interface to avoid hitting them accidentally changes since tunneling over ssh is now supported in the windows version see the installation section of the manual for detailed instructions the transport subsystem now includes an implementation of the rsync protocol built by sylvain gommier and norman ramsey this protocol achieves much faster transfers when only a small part of a large file has been changed by sending just diffs the rsync feature is off by default in the current version use the rsync switch to turn it on nb we still have a lot of tuning to do you may not notice much speedup yet were experimenting with a multithreaded transport subsystem written by jerome vouillon the downloadable binaries are still singlethreaded if you want to try the multithreaded version youll need to recompile from sources say make threadstrue native thread support from the compiler is required use the option threads n to select the maximal number of concurrent threads default is multithreaded and singlethreaded clientsservers can interoperate a new gtkbased user interface is now available thanks to jacques garrigue the tk user interface still works but well be shifting development effort to the gtk interface from now on ocaml is now required for compiling unison from sources the modules uitk and myfileselect have been changed to use labltk instead of camltk to compile the tk interface in windows you must have ocaml and tk when installing tk put it in ctcl rather than the suggested cprogram filestcl and be sure to install the headers and libraries which are not installed by default added a new addversionno switch which causes unison to use unisoncurrentversionnumber instead of just unison as the remote server command this allows multiple versions of unison to coexist conveniently on the same server whichever version is run on the client the same version will be selected on the server changes since incompatible change archive format has changed make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading to avoid spurious conflicts the first sync after upgrading will be slow this version fixes several annoying bugs including some cases where propagation of file permissions was not working umask is now ignored when creating directories directories are create writable so that a readonly directory and its contents can be propagated handling of warnings generated by the server synchronizing a path whose parent is not a directory on both sides is now flagged as erroneous fixed some bugs related to symnbolic links and nonexistant roots o when a change deletion or new contents is propagated onto a followed symlink the file pointed to by the link is now changed we used to change the link itself which doesnt fit our assertion that follow means the link is completely invisible o when one root did not exist propagating the other root on top of it used to fail becuase unison could not calculate the working directory into which to write changes this should be fixed a humanreadable timestamp has been added to unisons archive files the semantics of path and name regular expressions now correspond better some minor improvements to the text ui eg a command for going back to previous items the organization of the export directory has changed should be easier to find download things now changes since incompatible change archive format has changed make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading to avoid spurious conflicts the first sync after upgrading will be slow this version has not been tested extensively on windows major internal changes designed to make unison safer to run at the same time as the replicas are being changed by the user internal performance improvements changes since incompatible change archive format has changed make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading to avoid spurious conflicts the first sync after upgrading will be slow a number of internal functions have been changed to reduce the amount of memory allocation especially during the first synchronization this should help power users with very big replicas reimplementation of lowlevel remote procedure call stuff in preparation for adding rsynclike smart file transfer in a later release miscellaneous bug fixes changes since incompatible change archive format has changed make sure you synchronize your replicas before upgrading to avoid spurious conflicts the first sync after upgrading will be slow fixed some small bugs in the interpretation of ignore patterns fixed some problems that were preventing the windows version from working correctly when clickstarted fixes to treatment of file permissions under windows which were causing spurious reports of different permissions when synchronizing between windows and unix systems fixed one more nontailrecursive list processing function which was causing stack overflows when synchronizing very large replicas changes since the text user interface now provides commands for ignoring files we found and fixed some more nontailrecursive list processing functions some power users have reported success with very large replicas incompatible change files ending in tmp are no longer ignored automatically if you want to ignore such files put an appropriate ignore pattern in your profile incompatible change the syntax of ignore and follow patterns has changed instead of putting a line of the form ignore regexp in your profile unisondefaultprf you should put ignore regexp regexp moreover two other styles of pattern are also recognized ignore name name matches any path in which one component matches name while ignore path path matches exactly the path path standard globbing conventions can be used in name and path a matches any single character except a matches any sequence of characters not including xyz matches any character from the set x y z abbccc matches any one of a bb or ccc see the user manual for some examples changes since some users were reporting stack overflows when synchronizing huge directories we found and fixed some nontailrecursive list processing functions which we hope will solve the problem please give it a try and let us know major additions to the documentation changes since major internal tidying and many small bugfixes major additions to the user manual unison can now be started with no arguments it will prompt automatically for the name of a profile file containing the roots to be synchronized this makes it possible to start the graphical ui from a desktop icon fixed a small bug where the text ui on nt was raising a no such signal exception changes since the precompiled windows binary in the last release was compiled with an old ocaml compiler causing propagation of permissions not to work and perhaps leading to some other strange behaviors weve heard reports about this has been corrected if youre using precompiled binaries on windows please upgrade added a debug command line flag which controls debugging of various modules say debug xxx to enable debug tracing for module xxx or debug all to turn on absolutely everything fixed a small bug where the text ui on nt was raising a no such signal exception changes since incompatible change the names and formats of the preference files in the unison directory have changed in particular the file prefs should be renamed to defaultprf the contents of the file ignore should be merged into defaultprf each line of the form regexp in ignore should become a line of the form ignore regexp in defaultprf unison now handles permission bits and symbolic links see the manual for details you can now have different preference files in your unison directory if you start unison like this unison profilename ie with just one anonymous commandline argument then the file unisonprofilenameprf will be loaded instead of defaultprf some improvements to terminal handling in the text user interface added a switch killserver that terminates the remote server process when the unison client is shutting down even when using sockets for communication by default a remote server created using sshrsh is terminated automatically while a socket server is left running when started in socket server mode unison prints server started on stderr when it is ready to accept connections this may be useful for scripts that want to tell when a socketmode server has finished initalization we now make a nightly mirror of our current internal development tree in case anyone wants an uptotheminute version to hack around with added a file contrib with some

does not permitbr commercial skipping and that pvr would not br be a tivo br br to its credit tivo has been remarkably successful br at building brand loyalty and awareness tivo br reports that percent of its subscribers havebr recommended the service to a friend and whenbr people talk about pvrs they say tivo just br like the way people say coke when they talkbr about soft drinks br br but wall street the media and the industry br are all growing impatient tivo needs to startbr putting some big numbers on the board br and it needs to do it this holiday season if br it doesnt stock analysts who have supported tivo br until now will run for the hills that will pushbr the companys stock price down even further andbr if that happens tivo could have just two choicesbr sell the

i guess the first question here should be does anyone have some updates to the pgp code in exmh that i should know about my current problem is that if i get a pgp signed message i first get a button that reads check the signature with gnupg if i punch the button and i dont have the signature on my keyring then i get a message saying just that and the message cant check signature public key not found along with a button with the inscription query keyserver if i punch the button then exmh just hangs forever if instead of punching the button i go out to the keyserver myself and then try the message again everything works so it seems that it must be the code that goes out to the keyserver anyone else with this problem this is exmh v and tcltk a regclemens regdwfcom _______________________________________________ exmhusers mailing list exmhusersredhatcom

rohit was wondering what microsofts definition of a chief software architect is and consequently what microsoft thinks is a roadmap here you go from mr ballmer to mr gillmor to mr fork architecture is war love em or hate em at least microsoft understands that as chief sa billg oversees all product strategy there are two things a road map can be one is just a piece of paper that tells what everyone is doing and records a bunch of bottomup plans or it can be something where we impose more broadly our vision from the top we are not going to try to get everything shared thats a path for getting everything stopped up but at the same time we are trying to take the top four or five things we are trying to do in the longhorn wave yukon wave or the net wave and really have enough time to have some crosscutting discussions about how we make that happen bill gates is dedicated fulltime to being chief software architect he also happens to be chairman of the company but he spends most of his time being chief software architect we have a body now that meets every month the sltt senior leadership technical team basically the top people involved in the productcreating strategy and we present and discuss the issues bill is driving a process for each of these waves for instance he will ask what are the crosscutting scenarios that i want and then he will get all the right product groups together and bring these things in front of the sltt people talk about what it takes to be a good manager and people talk about being a good coach and getting people to like you in a large organization those things are important but at a certain level the most important thing you can do for your people to make them better is to give them a framework where they can work in harmony with the other people in the company and from bills perspective this framework is the technical road map and the sltt process it is the scenarios from my perspective it is the pl profit and loss structure and the multiple businesses because given how we work giving people a framework that gets them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the parts will mean we have better offerings ballmer in charge july pm pt no one knows better than microsoft ceo steve ballmer that as the net platform evolves the success of microsoft depends on how well the company coordinates its tool server and client strategies and how well it communicates that vision in an interview with infoworld test center director steve gillmor and infoworld editor at large ed scannell at microsoft fusion ballmer discussed the progress of net changes in the companys approach to product development and microsofts efforts to simplify product licensing and inspire trust in customers and partners last time we talked was two years ago at the beginning of the net era so where are we now in the net evolution let me start by talking about where i think we are in the xml revolution first and then i will talk about where we are with net i believe that the it industry collectively decided over the last three or four years that the world was going to be replatformed with xml as the key foundation its not like anyone ever got together to decide this but its like magnetic north where its been clearly indicated that everyone is rallying around the concept but i think the degree to which xml is pervasive might still be underestimated a lot of partners even at this conference see it as btob for big companies but it is really about the way software in general is designed it is all about the way security should work management everything is changed so to answer your direct question two years ago i might have said the jury is still out about whether xml was going to happen we were questioning if it was going to be a legitimate competitor to java but now the world has decided to embrace xml as the basis for the next generation of technology and there are a lot of benefits that come with it could it have been something other than xml sure it could have it wasnt the specific technical implementation it is merely the fact that it comes out of internet standards it has deeper semantic abilities it is all about interoperability and connection so in that context where are we with net ill say a couple things no i would say we have some momentum in the market we have customers using the net product line like merrill lynch credit suisse marks spencer citibank and a variety of others people who are doing some things for real i feel like the degree we are out front is in some ways smaller and in some ways larger how so smaller in the sense that everyone is talking the xml talk even sun bigger in the execution sense weve delivered we delivered the first batch of products that really were built xml to the core visual studio net and biztalk server and we are getting traction so i feel good about where our execution is relative to everyone else that is not to say that other people arent doing some reasonable bolton xml support for the stuff they have you have some heavy lifting to do to convince your customers and partners to follow along what do you have to do to set the standard for adoption and upgrading to this next generation we have to present the picture that we are behaving consistently within the framework of focusing on customer issues and customer satisfaction and trustworthy computing which we have articulated now there are some things i would have done differently in hindsight i would have increased the focus on not just security but deployment because a lot of the security problems are actually deployment problems we have the fix but sometimes we cant get the tools in their hands to deploy those fixes fast enough licensing i know i would have given more time and there are better ways to plan around the kinds of changes we made we are still going to have to get smart about the full ramifications do you expect any changes to be made between now and july to licensing there is a lot of pushback on this no there is nothing that will happen between now and july and we will continue to learn over time what we need to do to earn our customers trust and earn their business i think many of the people who are pushing back really dont even know the new terms isnt that your fault for not educating them yes it is our fault but you meet with plenty of customers whose companies already have licenses and they are saying i think theres a problem i dont deny there are some problems i am sure there are some issues we will have to work on over time after july we are going to see what the real issues are i was talking to a customer at the show who was saying he thought there would be a problem and i told him that we just completed a deal with his company and that he is now universally licensed and that total costs to his company are now lower than they were before and he said oh really so well go through july we have a lot of customers who have signed licenses and i am sure we are going to find some issues my bigger concerns today are probably not in the larger accounts but there may be some issues we need to address among the smallersize companies and we will how does the net initiative change the way inhouse client and server developers work together what we are trying to do for the health of net and the health of the company and the sanity of the people who work there and the quality of the products we produce is to have a more orchestrated berroad map of where we are going now there are two things a road map can be one is just a piece of paper that tells what everyone is doing and records a bunch of bottomup plans or it can be something where we impose more broadly our vision from the top we are not going to try to get everything shared thats a path for getting everything stopped up but at the same time we are trying to take the top four or five things we are trying to do in the longhorn wave yukon wave or the net wave and

pl profit and loss structure and the multiple businesses because given how we work giving people a framework that gets them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the parts will mean we have better offerings it seems the scenarios construct is really working for you is this an evolution of the solutions approach i would say it is a pretty direct extrapolation from the solutions stuff only i think we are just getting a little more experience i think we use the word scenarios more often and solutions less because solution sounds more like a fixed thing at the end of the day most of the things we do are customizable and programmable and so people make them into the solution they want but they are still scenarios what will software deployment look like well that is a scenario because it involves windows office and other applications we are working hard to make sure the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts thats not to say people are always comfortable with this i cant even say we will do it perfectly all we have to do is do it a lot better than we had been doing it i think that would be a big step forward for the customers will this approach cut down on some of the technology civil wars microsoft has had in the past involving who is going to gain control of a project this seems to be a very democratic approach to development i would not use the word democracy to describe it people have to come together and ultimately make some decisions this is not a voting process here the agenda of what we think is important we get a lot of input but once it is decided people dont get to vote with their feet we try to make a quantum leap here in terms of our ability to improve pulling together all the pieces our customers want us to do that simplifying concepts by unifying them the customers dont say they want us to do that but when we do do that they go ahhh i get it that makes sense i dont want to go to six more meetings where people say is your workflow strategy biztalk or whats your office workflow strategy or why is synchronization in some ways better for email and outlook than it is for file folders and web pages to get that sort of synchronization sometimes to get that highlevel road map to work you have to build something we dont have today so we have been talking about unifying storage and so the best way to get all this stuff to work is to get them all to work just one way then you just keep tuning one set of parameters instead of having a thousand flowers blooming in your fusion keynote today you talked about who your competitors are and it was the usual suspects but one you didnt mention is yourself you are competing against the last generation of your technology always given that our stuff doesnt wear out or break down you can question whether it breaks or not ballmer grins but it doesnt break down like machinery does to get anyone to do something new we have to have something interesting and innovative people think ok should we just do more upgrades or try to sell more new product we decided that users like us to do a level of systems integration so they dont have to get involved in that so take sharepoint team services which we put in office we could have sold team services as a separate product and we could have introduced a new sku stock keeping unit we could have decided if it should work down level with the old office or just the new version of office and we could do that with realtime communications but we tend to like to put things together integrate them and then release batches which are then upgrades as a form of introducing our new innovation but no matter how you do it because our stuff does not wear out we have to convince people that some idea we have is better or more powerful than the older idea we had and there are two aspects of doing that one aspect is on a given product or upgrade release does that make sense or do we convince you that over an nyear period of time we will have enough innovation that you will want to be licensed for that innovation and this is part of this whole licensing discussion we are having we moved to the new licensing for two reasons i would say no we wanted to simplify our licensing when we look back a year from now i guarantee you that where we are now is simpler than where we were nothing is simpler during a transition because they are learning the new and are more familiar with the old but i think people will eventually realize this is simpler our licensing got pretty complicated over the years and some people came to not understand it all the other issue is the timing of delivering our innovation i dont want to have a lot of rough questions from customers so when we do have new ideas its like ok should we put it in this upgrade or that one or just have a stream of stuff that only our best customers have access to under the terms of their contract i think in the long run we have a better chance of satisfying them with the latter than with hitting them with six different upgrades i am a fan of letting the customer decide ok i want that piece or this piece but they are licensed for all of it so those are the two things we sought to do that gets back to the trust issue where if you frontload it thats the big lumpy upgrade and if you backload it with the vision the net servers you have a long gap in the middle where you have to sell into an untrusting audience the truth is we need to be better at both there are some things you can only do big and lumpy like a new file system its not like some sort of small user feature if you change the file system then the storage the backup probaby those things are going to change probably the shell ought to changethe applications a lot of things are going to change can you call that lumpy or you can put out four new features in powerpoint sure that would not look lumpy to users i think we have to build trust in the model and we are going to have to deliver more over time it will not come overnight people will have to see that we do a few things that not all of our innovation is lumpy that more of it comes evenly and steadily people develop a confidence and faith they like both aspects of the model over time our support needs to become more intimately involved in that story we know that but we dont know exactly what that means yet and this whole notion of software as a service this is not a licensing or business discussion its how does software get rearchitected in the world of the internet i mean how many software products are fundamentally different because of the internet not many probably the antivirus guys keep up the best they are always feeding new virus support in i asked the audience at fusion how many use windows update now thats a small piece of software but it is big thats the consumer market weve got to get that to really purr in the corporate market the lack of broadband buildout and adoption seems to be holding up the ability for users to take advantage of some new services youre talking about when bill gates invested in comcast cable it triggered the baby bells to get on board with dsl what are you doing now to deal with that issue the no thing is we have to make software that is so compelling that people will start saying well of course i am going to get broadband and is one of those compelling features yes it is i was in a hotel in sun valley utah this week that was not wired so i turned on my pc and xp tells me there is a wireless network available so i connect to something called mountaineer well i dont know what that is but i have a vpn into microsoft it worked i dont know whose broadband i used i didnt see it in bills room i called him up and said hey come over to my room so soon everyone is there and connecting to the internet through my room we have to support all the modalities whether it is gprs general packet radio service or we have to make it easy to provision from a software perspective for things that go on with dsl and cable modems and the software has to want a broadband link there are not many things you do where you say i really care about the performance if i am downloading powerpoint files then i want broadband so when you can do things with speed that you otherwise cant do without speed that is going to put a lot of pressure on the broadband community thats the weird answer the more normal answer is yeah isnt it awful there is not enough broadband and the prices they charge i agree with all that if you look at what happened in japan recently there was a big drop it is now a month for dsl vroom they have gone from almost no dsl connections a year ago to million or million subscribers so how do we make that happen in this country i think that is beyond us if there is enough interest where the consumers are looking intensely for broadband whether it is at todays prices or tomorrows prices that is going to shake out the marketplace and i think the marketplace will do a good job we just have to make it something obvious that consumers want now i happen to live in a neigborhood where there is no broadband network no dsl or cable modems well i have a neighbor teledesic chairman and coceo craig mccaw who has a wireless network that i think i can piggyback off of ballmer laughs so yes broadband is a bottleneck but i also think we have to look at oursleves as a software industry and say arent we too some of that bottleneck we have not built software that makes broadband a musthave microsoft ceo weighs in ballmer addresses a number of key issues for customers and partners on security and trust there are some things i would have done differently on coordinating product groups we are working hard to make sure the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts on product licensing we are still going to have to get smart about the full ramifications adamxentcom long sig alert i believe it is quite possible to productively apply both supposedly incompatible approaches rest soap together ill sketch it out below both in prescriptive form note while this is proscriptive it is expected that local adaptations will be provided start by modeling the persistent resources that you wish to expose by persistent resources i am referring to entities that have a typical life expectancy of days or greater ensure that each instance has a unique url when possible assign meaningful names to resources whenever possible provide a default xml representation for each representation unlike traditional object oriented programming languages where there is a unique getter per property typically there will be a single representation of the entire instance these representations will often contain xlinks aka pointers or references to other instances now add high level methods which take care of all composite create update and delete operations a key aspect of the design is that messages for these operations need to be self contained both the sender and receiver should be able to make the absolute minimum of assumptions as to the others state and multiple requests should not be required to implement a single logical operation all requests should provide the appearance of being executed atomically query operations deserve special consideration a general purpose xml syntax should be provided in every case in addition when a reasonable expectation exists that query parameters will be of a relatively short size and not require significant encoding then a http get with the parameters encoded as a query string should also be provided implications the following table emphasizes how this unified approach differs from the pure albeit hypothetical different positions described above resource post operations explicitly have the possibility of modifying multiple resources put and delete operations are rarely used if ever gets may contain query arguments get gets must never be used for operations which observably change the state of the recipient post should be used instead message do not presume that urls are static instead presume that they identify the resource in particular recognize that urls can be dynamically generated expect urls of other soap resources in responses use the soap response mep for pure retrieval operations procedure treat the url itself as the implicit first parameter allow urls to be dynamically generated and returned in structures use http get for retrieval operations conclusions looking to the future the application level internetworking protocols that emerge today will likely be the application level intranetworking protocols of the next decade both rest and soap contain features that the others lack most significantly rest soap xlink the key bit of functionality that soap applications miss today is the ability to link together resources soap makes significant progress in addressing this hopefully wsdl will complete this important work soap rest stored procedures looking at how other large scale systems cope with updates provides some key insights into productive areas for future research with respect to rest finally it bears repeating just because a service is using http get doesnt mean that it is rest if you are encoding parameters on the url you are probably making an rpc request of a service not retrieving the representation of a resource it is worth reading roy fieldings thoughts on the subject the only exception to this rule that is routinely condoned within the rest crowd is queries sam ruby

i got to see powell talk in march at the beginning of his reign at the fcc he said they were going to take a real hands off approach so its funny that they would blame the regulators for causing the collapse one thing he did get right is that he wasnt worried that the us was behind europe in the wireless licensing spectrum this is something very prescient in that most of those licensors have had to eat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for very little benefit his legacy wasis supposed to be rethinking the fccs role to stay out of the way in this period of business innovation in the wireless space as he didnt want the government forcing business models onto the private sector his full transcript is here interestingly enough i got to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole ctia las vegas keynote series of speakers clay and i hoped a flight out of ontario to las vegas to do demo support for craig barrett his message was that theres no difference between wired and wireless internetits all the same thing instead of scalable networks we should be thinking about scalable content using magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial from a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with the content scaling back for each target platform the best part of the whole trip wasnt hobnobbing at all but really the fact that the venetian had ran out of rooms they decided to put us up in one of their night high roller rooms they put clay in one and me in another the venetian is known for having the largest hotel rooms anywhere but these ones were bigger than my whole house greg rohit khare wrote i cant believe i actually read a laughoutloud funny profile of the fcc commissioner fer crissakes so the following article comes recommended a fine explanation of michael powells extraordinary equivocation on the other hand i can also agree with werbachs werblog entry rohit a trip to fcc world nicholas lemann has a piece in the new yorker this week about fcc chairman michael powell its one of the first articles ive seen that captures some of powells real personality and the way hes viewed in washington unfortunately lemann ends by endorsing conventional political wisdom after describing how powell isnt really a firebreathing ideological conservative he concludes that in essence powell favors the inumbent local bell telephone companies while a democratic fcc would favor new entrants i know thats not how powell sees the world and though i disagree with him on many issues i think hes right to resist the old dichotomy the telecom collapse should be a humbling experience for anyone who went through it the disaster wasnt the regulators fault as some conservatives argue but something clearly went horribly wrong and policymakers should learn from that experience contrary to lemanns speculation the upstart carriers wont be successful in a gore administration because its too late virtually all of them are dead and wall street has turned off the capital tap for the foreseeable future some may survive but as small players rather than worlddominators the battle between clecs and rbocs that lemann so astutely parodies is old news the next important battle in telecom will be between those who want to stay within the traditional boxes and those who use different models entirely thats why open broadband networks and open spectrum are so important whatever the regulatory environment there is going to be consolidation in telecom those left out in that consolidation will face increasing pressure to create new pipes into the home or slowly die the victors in the consolidation game will cut back on innovation and raise prices which will create further pressure for alternatives lemann is right that policymaking looks much drier and more ambiguous on the ground than through the lens of history but hes wrong in thinking that telecoms future will be something like its past friday october am comments the chairman by nicholas lemann hes the other powell and no one is sure what hes up to new yorker october last year my middle son in eighth grade and encountering his first fairly serious americanhistory course indignantly reported that the whole subject was incomprehensible i was shocked what about gettysburg and the declaration of independence and the selmatomontgomery march just look at my textbook he said and when i did i saw his point his class had got up to the eighteenforties what i expected was a big beefing up of the roles of sacagawea and crispus attucks and indeed there was some of that but the main difference between my sons text and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in american history there were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and reciprocal trade agreements i skipped ahead past the civil war hoping for easier going only to encounter currency floats and the regulation of freight rates only a few decades into the twentieth century did it become possible to see the federal governments main function as responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests even now if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in washington what youd find is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage not so much over the public as over each other agribusiness versus real estate banks versus insurance companies and so on the arena in which this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them its an insiders game less because the players are secretive than because the public and the pressencouraged by the players who speak in jargon cant get themselves interested one corner of washington might be called fcc world for the federal communications commission fcc world has perhaps five thousand denizens they work at the commission itself at the house and senate commerce committees and at the washington offices of the companies that the commission regulates they read communications daily subscription price a year and every year around christmastime they grumblingly attend the chairmans dinner at a washington hotel where the high point of the evening is a scripted supposedly selfdeprecating comedy routine by the commissions chairman of all the federal agencies and commissions the fcc is the one that americans ought to be most interested in after all it is involved with a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the american economy as well as important aspects of daily lifetelephone and television and radio and newspapers and the internet and right now fcc world is in if not a crisis at least a very soapy lather because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the corporate scandals concerns the economic collapse of companies regulated by the fcc qwest worldcom adelphia and global crossing among others are or were part of fcc world aol time warner is part of fcc world jack grubman the former salomon smith barney analyst who seems to have succeeded kenneth lay of enron as the embodiment of the corporate scandals is part of fcc world in the past two years companies belonging to fcc world have lost trillions of dollars in stockmarket valuation and have collectively served as a dead weight pulling down the entire stock market this year an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state of the fcc has been circulating widely within fcc world it evokes fcc worlds feverish mood the fcc is fiddling while rome burns and suggests why nobody besides residents of fcc world has thought of the commission in connection with the corporate scandals the sentence i just quoted is followed by this explanation the ilecs appear likely to enter all ld markets within twelve months while losing virtually no residential customers to attackers since and suffering about market share loss in business lines to clecs its a lot easier to think about evil ceos than to decipher that even in good times fcc world pays obsessive attention to the commissions chairman in bad times the attention becomes especially intense and when the chairman is a celebrity fcc world devotes itself to fulltime chairmanwatching the current chairman michael powell is a celebrity at least by governmentofficial standards because he is the only son of colin powell the secretary of state unlike his father he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity which generates enormous and at times apoplectically toned speculation about who he really is and what hes really up to powell is young to be the head of a federal agencyhe is thirtynineand genially charming everybody likes him before becoming chairman he was for three years one of the fccs five commissioners not only is he fluent in the fccs incomprehensible patois he has a clintonesque love of the arcane details of communications policy hes always saying that hes an avid moderate and yet he has a rageinciting quality one of his predecessors as chairman reed hundt quoted in forbes compared powell to herbert hoover mark cooper of the consumer federation of america calls him radical and extreme just as often as hes accused of being a rightwing ideologue powell gets accused of being paralytically cautious it aint about singing kumbayah around the campfire another former chairman william kennard says you have to have an answer one day last spring powell testifying before a senate subcommittee delivered an anodyne opening statement and the subcommittees chairman ernest hollings of south carolina berated him you dont care about these regulations hollings said you dont care about the law or what congress sets down thats the fundamental thats the misgiving i have of your administration over there it just is amazing to me you just pellmell down the road and seem to not care at all i think youd be a wonderful executive vicepresident of a chamber of commerce but not a chairman of a regulatory commission at the government level are you happy in your job extremely powell said with an amiable smile one can not understand powells maddening effect at least on democrats and liberal activists without understanding not just the stated purpose of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose the fcc was created by congress in but it existed in prototype well before the new deal because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy cases for government intervention in the private economy making sure that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves its other original function was preventing american telephone telegraph the national monopoly phone company from treating its customers unfairly over the decades as fcc world grew up into a comfortable wellestablished place the fcc segued into the role of industrial supervisionits real purpose it was supposed to manage the competition among communications companies so that it didnt become too bloody by artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business in addition to looking out for the publics interest the commission more specifically protected the interests of members of congress many of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most terrifying category of interest groupyou can cross the local bank president and live to tell the tale but not the local broadcaster according to an ofttold fcc world anecdote president clinton once blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers in the same city because he said if the soandso who owned the anticlinton little rock democratgazette had owned the leading tv station in little rock too clinton would never have become president fcc world may have been con tentious but it was settled too because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic niches for themselves then in the nineteeneighties the successful breakup of at tby far the biggest and most important company the commission regulateddeposited a thick additional sediment of selfconfidence onto the consciousness of fcc world a generation ago for most americans there was one local phone company one longdistance company and one company that manufactured telephones which customers were not permitted to ownand they were all the same company it was illegal to plug any device into a phone line by the midnineteennineties there were a dozen economically viable local phone companies a handful of national longdistance companies competing to offer customers the lowest price and best service and stores everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturersand millions of americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the telephone lines at t had argued for years that it was a natural monopoly requiring protection from economic competition and total control over its lines so much for that argument over the same period the fcc had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones and the internet it was the dream of federalagency success come true consumers vastly better served and the industry much bigger and more prosperous too the next big step was supposed to be the telecommunications act of one of those massive endlessly lobbiedover pieces of legislation which most people outside fcc world probably felt it was safe to ignore although the telecom act sailed under the rhetorical banner of modernization and deregulation its essence was a grand interestgroup bargain in which the local phone companies known to headline writers as baby bells and to fcc world as arbocks the pronounced version of rbocs or regional bell operating companies would be permitted to offer longdistance service in exchange for letting the longdistance companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for customers consumers would win because for the first time they would get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more competition than they already had in long distance but the politics and economics of the telecom act which was shepherded through congress by vicepresident gore were just as important democrats saw the act as helping to reposition them as the technology partythe party that brought the internet into every home created hundreds of thousands of jobs in new companies and not least set off an investment boom whose beneficiaries might become the partys new contributor base clintons slogans about the information superhighway and building a bridge to the twentyfirst century which like all clinton slogans artfully sent different messages to different constituencies were the rhetorical correlates of the telecom act and gores cruise to the presidency was supposed to be powered substantially by the acts success the fcc had a crucial role in all this the arbocks are rich aggressive politically powerful and generally republican though like all important interest groups they work with both parties they immediately filed lawsuits which wound up tying the hands of their new competitors in the local phone market for more than three years through rulemaking enforcement and litigation the fcc then headed by reed hundt who was gores classmate at st albans was supposed to keep the arbocks in their cages so that not only longdistance companies like at t and mci worldcom but also a whole category of new companies seelecks the pronounced version of clecs or competitive local exchange carriers could emerge this entailed the regulatory equivalent of handtohand combat the seeleck is supposed to have access to the arbocks switching equipment the arbock wont give the seeleck a key to the room where its kept so the seeleck asks the fcc to rule that the arbock has to give it the key partly because hundt assured the seelecks and other new companies that he would protect them and partly because of the generally booming condition of the economy then investment capital flooded into the seeleckscompanies with names like winstar covad and teligentand into other telecommunications companies even not obviously related technology companies like cisco systems benefitted from the telecom boom demand for their products was supposed to come from the seelecks and other new players there would be no conflict between the interests of the new telecom companies and those of consumers as one of hundts former lieutenants told me reed used to joke that my job was to make sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up the years following the passage of the telecom act were the peak of the boom wall street had its blood up and that meant not just more startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies time warner and aol decided to throw in together and at t and comcast and so on surely worldcom and the other telecom bad guys believed that their selfdealing stockoverselling and creative accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating by the time the outcome of the presidential election had been determined the telecom crash was well under way nonetheless the chairmanship of the fcc remained one of the best jobs in terms of influence and visibility available to a career government regulator three republicans emerged as candidates powell who was a commissioner harold furchtgottroth the farthesttotheright commissioner and patrick wood the head of the texas public utility commission and as such a george w bush guy in texas however wood had crossed the most powerful person in the arbock camp edward whitacre the ceo of sbc communications which is headquartered in san antonio this meant that the arbocks didnt want wood as head of the fcc because he might be too proseeleck wood is now the head of the federal energy regulatory commission michael powell had to signal the arbocks that he wasnt as threatening as wood while also signalling the conservative movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than furchtgottroth powell did this deftly for example in december of he appeared before a conservative group called the progress freedom foundation and gave a very michael powell speechwhimsical intellectual and freeassociative biblical history joseph schumpeter moores lawthat began by making fun of the idea that the fcc should try to keep new telecom companies alive in the wake of the act the fcc is often cast as the grinch who stole christmas powell said like the whos down in whoville who feast on whopudding and rare whoroast beast the communications industry was preparing to feast on the deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the acts fertile soil but this feast the fcc grinch did not like in the least so it is thought thus powell was indicating that if he became chairman he didnt expect to administer first aid to the seelecks as part of the job he was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day of the bush administration twenty months into the administration nearly all the seelecks are dead or dying nearly all longdistance companies not just worldcom are in serious trouble cable companies have lost half their value satellite companies are staggering the crash has had an automatically concentrating effect because as new companies die the existing companies market share increases and if the existing companies are in good shape financially they have the opportunity to pick up damaged companies at bargain prices during the bush administration as the financial carnage in communications has worsened the communications industry has moved in the direction of more concentration if the bells wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service and if they also merge the country will be on its way to having a national duopoly in local service verizon in the east and sbc in the west and these companies could dominate long distance as well because of the poor health of the longdistance companies the cable business also seems close to having two dominant national companies aol time warner and comcast unlike the phone companies they dont have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more fully control what material they allow to enter peoples homes as part of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the telecom act the limits on concentration in the radio industry were significantly loosened and in the past six years the number of radiostation owners in the united states has been cut by twentyfive per cent today a large portion of local and national radio news programming is supplied by a single company westwood one a subsidiary of viacom in this situation many democrats and liberals think the fcc should be hyperactivethe superhero of government regulation springing to the rescue of both consumers and the communications industry it should try to breathe life into the seelecks and other new companies it should disallow mergers maintain ownership limits and otherwise restrain the forces of concentration it should use the governments money and muscle to get new technologyespecially fast internet connectionsinto the homes of people who cant afford it at current market prices an analogy that a lot of people in fcc world make is between telecom and the middle east the clinton people blame the bloodshed on the bush people because they disengaged when they came into office and the bush people blame it on the clinton people because they raised too many expectations and stirred too many passions but michael powells fcc has not been hyperactive powell has been conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the fcc and waiting for the federal courts and the congress to send him signals in midseptember powell finally initiated a formal review of the fccs limits on media concentration this doesnt mean he has been inactive rather he has been active in a way that further infuriates his criticsin a manner that smoothly blends the genial and the provocative he muses about whether the fundamental premises of fcc world really make sense while giving the impression that hes having the time of his life as chairman at his first press conference when he was asked what he was going to do about the digital dividethat is economic inequality in access to the internethe said you know i think there is a mercedes divide id like to have one and i cant afford one at the national cable telecommunications association convention in chicago powell following a troupe of tumblers to the stage interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a somersault not long ago i went to see powell in his office at the fcc until when the commission moved to a new building in southwest washington near the citys openair fish market fcc world was at the western edge of downtown where everybody would encounter everybody else at a few familiar restaurants and bars today the fcc building looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park even the chairmans suite though large is beige carpeted and fluorescent powell is a bulky man who wears goldrimmed glasses and walks with a pronounced limp the result of injuries he suffered in a jeep accident in germany in when he was an army officer because of the accident he left the army and went to law school where he became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation particularly the idea that the government rather than trying to correct the flaws of the market before the factprophylactically as he likes to sayshould wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust litigation to fix them he worked briefly at a corporate law firm and then became a protégé of joel klein the head of the antitrust division of the clinton justice department and the man who led the governments legal case against microsoft he was recently appointed chancellor of the new york publicschool system it testifies to powells political skill that he is probably the only high official in the bush administration who not only served in the clinton administration but also maintains close ties to bushs nemesis senator john mccain of arizona one of the things about powell that annoy people is his enduring love of law schoolits sort of like a lawschool study session over there one democratic former commissioner said as if to confirm the charge powell when i arrived introduced me to four law students summer interns at the commission whom hed invited to sit in i began by asking powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions of the fcc for example could private companies have apportioned the airwaves among themselves without the government being involved i think well never know powell said i dont think its an automatically bad idea the way some people will argue land is probably the best analogue we dont seize all the land in the united states and say the government will issue licenses to use land if my neighbor puts a fence one foot onto my property line theres a whole body of law about what i can do about that including whether i can tear it down if a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company its a similar proposition there are scholars who argueindeed the famous ronald coase treatise that won the nobel prize was about thisthat spectrum policy is lunacy the market could work this out in the kinds of ways that were accustomed to talking to powell was fun unlike most high government officials he doesnt seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding he slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs he speaks in ironic air quotes hes like your libertarian friend in college who enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he sees as sentimental or illogical after a while i asked him whether he thought his predecessors excitement about the telecommunications act had been excessive i would start with a caveat powell said look i cant fault those judgments in and of themselves given the time and what people thought they were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities but frankly ive always been a little bit critical first of all anybody who works with the act knows that it doesnt come anywhere close to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it by the president on down about the kinds of things its going to open up i mean i dont know what provisions are the informationsuperhighway provisions or what provisions are so digitally oriented or some of the things that were a big part of the theatre of its introduction when one starts reading the details one searches often in vain for these provisions but nonetheless there was a rising dotcom excitement and an internet excitement and people thought this was historic legislation and it certainly was but we were sucking helium out of balloons with the kinds of expectations that were being bandied around and this is before the economy or the market even gets in trouble it was a dramatically exaggerated expectationby the leadership of the commission by politicians by the market itself by companies themselves it was a gold rush and led to some very detrimental business decisions ones that government encouraged by its policies frankly everybody wanted to see numbers go up on the board powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the telecom act i want to see ten competitors twenty competitors i want to see thirtypercent market share fiftypercent market share i want the bells to bleed then well know weve succeeded now powell returned to being powell i think that expectation was astonishingly unrealistic in the short term they wanted to see it while theyre there we were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking and the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking theres no question we went too soon too fast too many companies took on too much debt too fast before the market really had a product or a business model how could the telecom act have been handled better we could have chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective and were slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system powell said money chased what seemed like governmentpromised opportunity the problem with that is theres a morning after and were in it and the problem is there is no short fix for this problem this debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level in some ways for shortterm gain we paid a price in longterm stability powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there had been a more reasonable level of investment no we wouldnt have every home in america with competitive choice yetbut we dont anyway i dont think its the remonopolization of telephone service i dont buy that the bells will prosper but did anybody believe they wouldnt the part of the story that didnt materialize was that people thought so would mci worldcom and sprint other local phone companies he added hadnt materialized as viable businesses either and they never might everybodys always saying the regulators did this and this and this but candidly the storys quite the opposite i think the regulators bent over backward for six years to give them a chance conditions dont get that good except once every thirty years and it didnt happen so whatever the reason were looking at a worldcom thats teetering were looking at a longdistance business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base at t is breaking itself up sprint has struggled could the fcc have done anything to make the longdistance companies stronger at the fcc i think ill just be blunt my political answer yes theres all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try to help but i cant find thirty billion dollars for worldcom somewhere i cant mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an sec investigation were i king it would be wonderful but i dont have those kinds of levers i dont know whether anybody does at some point companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from dying powell couldnt have made it much clearer that he doesnt think its his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash he has demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist gesturesin august for example five months after disbanding the fccs accounting safeguards division powell announced that he was appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the communications industry but that shows that powell is better at riding out the storm than say harvey pitt his counterpart at the securities and exchange commission and does not mean that he plans to try to shore up the telecom industry i asked powell if it would bother him if for most people only one company provided cable television and only one provided local phone service yes he said it concerns us that theres one of each of those things but lets not diminish the importance of there being one of each of those things that still is a nice suite of communications capabilities even if they arent direct analogues of each other anyway powell said before long the phone companies will be able to provide video service over their lines and the cable companies will provide data service over their lines so there will be more choice so yeah we have this anxiety we have one of everything the question is does it stay that way the concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of information did not appear to trouble powell either he said that people confuse bigness which brings many benefits with concentration which distorts markets if this were just economics its easy if you were to say to me mike just worry about economic concentration we know how to do thatthe econometrics of antitrust i can tell you when a markets too concentrated and prices are going to rise the problem is other dimensions like political ideological sometimes emotional take the question of if everybodys controlling what you see the assumption there is that somehow therell be this viewpoint a monolithic viewpoint pushed on you by your media and you wont get diversity i think thats a possibility i dont think its nearly the possibility thats ascribed to it sometimes powell explained sometimes when we see very pointed political or parochial programming it gets attacked as unfair i see some of the same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when rush limbaugh exists they love diversity but somehow we should run howard stern off the planet if it has a point of view then it becomes accused of bias and then we have policies likehere his tone went from ironic to sarcasticthe fairness doctrine which seems to me like the antithesis of what i thought those people cared about so when somebody is pointed and opinionated we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic fairness and integrity or whatever to make them balance it out fcc world abounds in theories about michael powell one is that he cant make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries he regulatesso he talks and talks and talks flamboyantly about the market in order to buy himself time another is that hes carrying water for the arbocks and the big cable companies another is that he is planning to run for the senate from virginia or to be appointed attorney general in a second bush term and doesnt want to do anything at the fcc that would diminish his chances another is that hes waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action so that he doesnt wind up going first and getting caught in the crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television networks in fcc world this is known as the powell doctrine of telecom after colin powells idea that the united states should never commit itself militarily without a clear objective overwhelming force and an exit strategy and another is that he actually believes what he says and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural healthy and irreversible and more concentration would be just fine this is why elections matter reed hundt who isnt happy about what has become of his telecom act told me its true that the fccmuch more than say the war in afghanistanis a case in which a gore administration would be acting quite differently from the bush administration consumers might have noticed the difference by now but theres no question whether communications companies have noticed the arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would have done if gore had won next election theyll help the party that helped them if the republicans win policy will tilt further in the arbocks favor if they lose perhaps the arbocks rivalsthe longdistance companies and the telecommunications upstartswith their friends now in power will stage a comeback americas present is not unrecognizably different from americas past gregory alan bolcer cto work gbolcer at endeavorscom endeavors technology inc cell

probably related to my not having an unseen sequence anywhere certainly not in inbox i read all of my outstanding mail before i tried this new exmh second ive been used to having a key binding which was to msg_markunseen which doesnt seem to exist any more and im not sure what i should replace that with theres obviously a way as the sequences menu does this the mark unseen menu entry in the message more menu is still wanting that function as well for those who have other sequences defined the window will widen to display the other sequences any chance of having that lengthen instead i like all my exmh stuff in nice columns fits the display better that is i use the detached folder list one column the main exmh window takes up full screen top to bottom but less than half the width etc i have space for more sequences in the unseen window as long as they remain once nice narrow window best would be if the sequences could be ordered by some preference then ones which didnt fit would just fall off the bottom and not be shown id also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring just one constant colour i have been running the unseen window with background black on a root window that is all black with no borders or other decorations but made sticky the appearance is just like the folders with unseen messages and their counts are written into the root window because it is sticky this small display follows me around and do i can see when new mail needs processing i also find that i tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur in one folder some i had forgotten i ever created so in addition to the sequences to always show and sequences to never show a preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder would be useful and then have the sequences that occor only in the folder im visiting appear in the list when that folder is current this is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining productive i quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message in a folder the name is used only there and only for one message it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is packed sorted etc i havent updated my exmh for some time now so im not sure if this next one is new or just new since but the sequences menu on the bar with new flist search only contains unseen and urgent it would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder happens to have defined a new sequence entry would also be useful to mark the message with a sequence name that didnt previously exist which can be done now using search and the pick interface but is clumsy that way actually you once could now when i try this entering a sequence name in the pick box and a single message number or a range nn in the list of messages and no pick attributes at all i now get syntax error in expression int hit while executing expr intminlinenomsgidminmsgidmaxlinenominlinenomaxmsgidminmsgid

changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a week or so ago any chance of making the current message a little brighter background just to make it stand out a fraction more than it does maybe this is more apparent to me than many as i use very small fonts everywhere the background of the ftoc line isnt very wide hope this helps kre _______________________________________________

on pm robert harley harleyargotech wrote ps funny how the new world world population supposedly had no immunity to old world diseases and died like flies but the old world population was completely unaffected by new world diseases other than tabacco and syphilis bullshit meter redlining again you arent the first person to ask this question but over the last few years there have been some good answers to this coming from the genetics research folks as i understand it there is a growing body of genetic evidence that european immune systems are substantially tougher and more resistant to a wider range of infectious diseases than those found in other peoples around the world including a surprisingly wide range of hereditary immunities and partial immunitiesresistance to common viruses and bacteria found around the world as a result when the first wholesale mixing of people from different parts of the world started occurring on a regular basis the europeans fared much better than most others the standard theory for this is that europe was the first major region of the planet to become densely populated and urbanized to the extent that they urbanized a thousand years ago because of this europe was a festering cauldron of disease without the benefit of modern sanitation and medicine for a thousand plus years much more so than the rest of the world and suffered from repeated largescale epidemics and plagues that took severe tolls on the population modern ethnic europeans have genetics that survived a unique and brutal culling process by a rather extensive range of diseases over dozens of generations what the geneticists are discovering is that for a great many of the worlds most common infectious diseases there is a percentage of the ethnically european population that has hereditary immunity and an even larger segment that has at least some hereditary resistance compared to people from other parts of the world and for most ethnic europeans it isnt just one disease they have varying levels of genetic resistance to a veritable cornucopia of infectious diseases because of similarities in the mechanisms and characteristics of viruses and other pathogens around the world to ones that europeans were exposed to the robust defenses their genetics provided them against their native diseases frequently imparted some resistance to diseases which they had never been exposed cheers james rogers jamesrbestcom

well all the transhumanists should be very interested in this one crossspecies testes transplant successful august newscientistcom news service testis tissue from goats and pigs has been grafted onto the backs of mice and shown to produce normal sperm capable of fertilising eggs it is the first time testis tissue from such distant species has produced mature sperm when grafted in mice it might work for primates or even humans claims ina dobrinski of the university of pennsylvania one of the coauthors of the study if so the technique could be used to preserve the reproductive potential of male cancer patients about to undergo therapies that would destroy their ability to make sperm men often freeze sperm samples before receiving chemotherapy but young boys can not do this because they do not produce mature sperm if it works in humans the technique would allow testis tissue grafted from boys to mature and produce sperm infectious particles the mouse grafting technique also has an advantage over another option for preserving fertility testicular transplants these involve reimplanting preserved germ cells into the testes after cancer remission but the grafting approach would eliminate any possibility of passing cancer cells back to the patient says reproductive biologist michael griswold from washington state university however it is possible that the grafting procedure could introduce mousederived infectious particles into human embryos making some scientists wary of the idea i would very much hesitate to say that its something we should be doing says reproductive biologist roger gosden of the east virginia medical school castrated mice in the study dobrinski and colleagues placed small pieces of testis tissue from newborn goats or pigs just under the skin on the backs of castrated mice two to four weeks later they found that more than half of the grafts had survived and were producing normallooking goat or pig sperm when they injected the graftderived sperm directly into eggs they saw clear signs of fertilisation indicating that the sperm function normally the researchers also found that the procedure worked just as well with testis tissue that had been refrigerated for two days or frozen for several weeks gosden has tried transplanting human testes tissue into mice but was not successful however dobrinski believes the technique could soon be used to preserve the germ lines of endangered species including rare animals that usually die in captivity before reaching sexual maturity we think thats a very real application she says she adds that mice with human testis tissue grafts would also be useful to scientists who want to test the effects of toxic substances and new contraceptives on human sperm production journal reference nature vol p robin orwant

this is for those that have interacted with d winer daves idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around youre supposed to just shut up and take it whos the real monster it seems good ol uncle dave is once again trying to savage anyone that dares to disagree with him it seems ben kevin and bill are making too strong a case so here we daves attempt to fool you into thinking theyre some sort of monsters violent ones no less anyone who works with hemenway or kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters who will stoop to any level to get their way yeah sure dave whatever you need to believe the truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and improving rss in general each with their own brand of attitude to be sure but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move forward how is that being monstrous is dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the publics perception of them if you havent already contact them and ask them how they feel about this foolishness am discuss dave deflects what he cant take the time to understand its really quite pitiful when normal people dont understand something they usually try learning about it they read up ask questions and seek the help of those that understand it this before shooting their mouths off and looking like fools what dave does is just the opposite posts a link to something he doesnt understand gets a bunch of email from people who do understand it derides the idea as being too much trouble and blogs it expects others to do research for him abuses anyone who tries to help him pontificates incorrectly about only part of the issue realizes hes been a fool but refuses to correct himself plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy tries making the educated people look like fools sends private emails to them trying to scare them off exposes any private email they write out of context deflects and runs off to some new topic repeats from his continued diatribes about rss and its use of rdf reveal this to be true dave doesnt get the idea of the semantic web hed rather have you follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth trying one reader wrote to us with a good analogy its like that movie the poseidon adventure daves like the purser ranting and raving that the passengers should follow him and march toward the bow i dont know about you but id rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room the ships fucking sinking and i dont want to be following the idiot daves idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around youre supposed to just shut up and take it after all why would good ol uncle dave want to hurt you its all about love right to hell with asking you if you want to get shafted and if you dare complain he savages you then he tries to make everyone think youre the one causing all the trouble weve news for you dave were wise to your tactics and were talking amongst ourselves about it were routing around you damaging behavoir thats where were coming from if you have an example of how youve tried to help dave please drop us an email about it well keep it strictly confidential of course send it along to zaphodegroupscom am discuss trying to talk with dave is like trying to wrestle a pig the trouble is you get dirty and the pig seems to like it another developer tries talking to dave and discovers its fundamentally impossible his basic response was just that rdf was a joke and the semantic web developers are doing a terrible job in the span of less than five minutes dave makes such an ass of himself that people at other tables start whispering that guy is an idiot the zaphodim however are veteran pig wrestlers if youve got a similar tale from the mud pit be sure to drop us a line at zaphodegroupscom pm discuss response aha some backing down by the whining one it would appear the dictator release strategy that daves been trying on his crappy little set of rss hacks is failing to gain support im going to push back the caveatremoving on the spec by hours still have work to do on the sample file i want to look into the rfc for timedate specs and get started on the radio implementation of i have to prepare for seybold tomorrow and i want to a little memorial for a busy few days for a guy still recovering also it would be great if people who make content tools could review the spec and see if there are any dealstoppers hell yeah there are deal stoppers like nobody wants it nor will they use it the poor radio customers the poor salon blog users theyre going to be dragged unwillingly into producing xml content that nobody will use so with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch dave is going to turn all their content into totally unsupported garbage ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start getting rejected of course at the same time dave tries to play the sympathy card what utter fucking nonsense this past weekend the blogosphere excoriates him for his blame america bullshit then the rss community tells him to get stuffed with his dictator release of rss now hes trying to pretend we should be nice to him because hes still recovering uh dave if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking fights well still kick your ass regardless thats what years of your abusing people has gotten you dave no sympathy anymore none whatsoever pm discuss dave is scary on posted on scripting news on note during the day tomorrow there will be no updates to scripting news ill be in sf at seybold leading a discussion on web services for publishing with people from amazon apple google and jake savin of userland i may be able to update my radio weblog but only if theres something really important to report so best wishes for a happy and safe what kind of asshole wishes people a happy obviously someone who doesnt have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy am discuss yeow and we though we were harsh wow apparently daves sticking his neck out quite far these days craig schamp practically keelhauls him with this one he wraps it up with the man seems to show over and over that hes nothing more than a whining buffoon give that man an honorary zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring related links over at photodude richard bennett andrea harris reid stott jeff jarvis ipse dixit and the fat guy pm discuss rss code name hitler if dave tries to steamroll rss through without formal community consensus here now we call it the hitler release of no objections no he means no objections i choose to hear dave is simply not listening people are objecting all over am discuss referral log funnies every now and then we check the referral logs to see whats pointing back to us we sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search pm discuss luserland attempts to trademark rss dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any bigco that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally bankrupt scripting news is full of examples so we found it surprising as did many others when luserland software tried to patent the term rss back in heres the patent application this was apparently just between the start of the rss development efforts and the publication of the specification winer knew about the rss stuff indeed he complained about it bitterly at the time could dave be any more transparent since when has dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others to do a good quote from before he filed the patent application tim oreilly says patents are ok hes just against stupid patents in the spirit of touch of grey tim man patents are lockin of the worst kind theres no way to route around them am discuss whens a permalink not a permalink when dave writes an item then removes it the permalink links to nothing at that point so apparently the perma part in permalink is permanent for everyone except dave too bad his little attempt at a definition fails to mention this pm discuss

followups to spambayespythonorg please unless youre specifically concerned about some particular bit of email policy for pythonorg ok after much fiddling with and tweaking of etceximeximconf and etceximlocal_scanpy on mailpythonorg i am fairly confident that i can start harvesting all incoming email at a moments notice for the record heres how it all works eximconf works almost exactly the same as before if the file etceximharvest does not exist that is any junk mail condition that can be detected by exim acls access control lists is handled entirely in eximconf the message is rejected before it ever gets to local_scanpy this covers such diverse cases as message from known spammer reject after every rcpt to command no messageid header and bit chars in subject both rejected after the message headersbody are read the main things i have changed in the absence of etceximharvest are dont check for bit chars in from header the vast majority of hits for this test were bounces from some asian isp the remaining hits should be handled by spamassassin do header sender verification ie ensure that theres a verifiable email address in at least one of from replyto and sender as late as possible because it requires dns lookups which can be slow and can also make messages that should have been rejected merely be deferred if those dns lookups timeout if etceximharvest exists then the behaviour of all of those acls in eximconf suddenly changes instead of rejecting recipients or messages they add an xreject header to the message this header is purely for internal use it records the name of the folder to which the rejected message should be saved and also gives the smtp error message which should ultimately be used to reject the message thus those messages will now be seen by local_scanpy which now looks for the xreject header if found it uses the folder name specified there to save the message and then rejects it with the smtp error message also given in xreject currently xreject is retained in saved messages if a message was not tagged with xreject then local_scanpy runs the usual virus and spam checks namely my homebrew scan for attachments with filenames that look like windows executables and a run through spamassassin the logic is basically this if virus folder virus else run through spamassassin if score folder rejectedspam elif score folder caughtspam finally local_scanpy writes the message to the designated folder by far the biggest folder will be accepted the server handles incoming messages per day of which maybe are junk mail oops just realized i havent written the code that actually saves the message dohh also havent written anything to discriminate personal email which i must do sigh finally the big catch waiting until after youve read the message headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic because certain broken mtas including those used by some spammers dont consider a xx after data as a permanent error but keep retrying dohh this is a minor annoyance currently where a fair amount of stuff is rejected at rcpt to time but in harvest mode everything with the exception of people probing for open relays will be rejected at data time so i have cooked up something called the asbl or automated sender blacklist this is just a berkeley db file that maps sender_ip sender_address to an expiry time when local_scan rejects a message from sender_ip sender_address for whatever reason including finding an xreject header added by an acl in eximconf it adds a record to the asbl with an expiry time hours in the future meanwhile theres an acl in eximconf that checks for records in the asbl if theres a record for the current sender_ip sender_address that hasnt expired yet we reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or body the downside of this from the pointofview of corpus collection is that if some jerk is busily spamming pythonorg one smtp connection per address we will most likely only get one copy this is a win if youre just thinking about reducing server load and bandwidth but im not sure if its helpful for training spam detectors tim happy harvesting greg greg ward gwardpythonnet budgets in the red lets tax religion dead kennedys

featured in nnt particularly in the premium issue we replied that popups can be annoying but while not defending them we must realize that they are a form of marketing in which the site owner hopes to recover his costs and possibly make a profit we suggested using a popup stopper there are lots of them on the web and alt f will quickly close active popup windows finally we pointed out that no publication can guarantee only sites without popup ads as weve often said in the past the internet isnt free and never was someone has to pay the freight and if those ads are unprofitable they will cease to exist extension search next time a file extension has you puzzled try the database at information dumb messages revisited not long ago we mentioned a few dumb messages we see from our computer and invited others to share their favorite dumbness a reader frequently gets a banner ad that asks do you click on banner ads she asks if you dont how do you click no without clicking on the banner ad others galled at their computers crashing then sitting through the scandisk operation and being reminded to avoid seeing this screen again always shut down windows properly as if it was their fault another reader nominates the download site at for having a really dumb comment after downloading a windows update it says how to get started you dont need to do anything after downloading and he asks whats the point of downloading still another reader nominates the instruction manual for the windows internet information server ils accessible only when ils is operating thus the entire section on troubleshooting a nonfunctional installation is inaccessible at precisely the moment one needs to consult it but judging by the sheer quantity of email the top dumb instruction has to be

the historical record by which you mean human historical record is highly overrated nigh worthless when you are talking about geological timescales even on topics with as short a timescale as climate there has been a significant recent increase in global co concentrations the vast preponderance of the new co in the atmosphere is due to human activity starting around the industrialization of europe and accelerating after wwii most scientists studying global climate change believe that these increased co concentrations are the primary causal agent for increased global warming hence our interest in items of human time scale it is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited during the last major ice age they are finding substantial evidence of humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers paved over their civilization the receding glaciers have turned into a bit of an archaeological treasure chest as they expose artifacts buried in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the ice for thousands of years i dont see any compelling reason to save the glaciers anyway particularly in light of the fact that their existence has always been transient most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the past have often been much warmer than today the point of global warming isnt to save the earth the planet is not sentient the point is to understand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on global human activity for anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another ill just stick with occams razor for now the increase in atmospheric co concentration is due to human activity it is generally accepted that increases in co in a closed environment subject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy this is the current best explanation for the high temperature of venus if the co concentration goes up globally which it has then theory states the earth should be retaining greater solar energy this process may be slow and may be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide i encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking co to eventual increases in global energy content part of which will be evident as heat jim

seem like all iraq all the time in the oval office but the president has at least one other thing on his mind this week that pesky port lockout the freight still isnt moving factories are running out of parts produce is rotting and retailers are more freaked about christmas with every passing day on monday bush stepped in and appointed a threemember panel to see how badly this shutdown is hosing the economy we hope this isnt a difficult question as the panels been given all of one day to report back when bush gets the report on tuesday the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the tafthartley act that would send employees back to work for days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their xanax dosages invoking tafthartley requires a threat to national health or safety not the economy but labor secretary elaine chao covered that base in a statement on monday saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military we knew iraq would be in here somewhere union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the day shutdown said the la times but an anonymous bush administration official said that only a portion of what the defense department needs has made it ashore politically this has been a tricky one using tafthartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections on the other hand voter discontent with bushs handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the republican administration said the san francisco chronicle also bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported twothirds of americans wanted him to focus more on the economy though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy andmerited federal intervention said the ap as for tafthartley its not exactly famous for solving labor disputes often the day coolingoff period ends and workers simply walk out again or get locked out again in this

hi folks i maintain a colocated server on behalf of a small group of individuals and am looking at backup solutions is it possible to get some sort of low end internal tape other solution that could be used to back up approx gigs of data or am i just dreaming my isp does offer backups at extra cost but the only problem with that is well the extra cost what i was hoping to do was to install some kind of internal tape device then swap tapes round every month so i had an onsite backup of say the last hours and an offsite backup of the last month is this feasible im beginning to think it isnt external devices are not an option as part of the charge for colocation is rackspace thanks ciaran irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

request for urgent business relationship dear sir firstly i must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this transaction this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret though i know that a transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried but i am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day we have decided to contact you first by your email due to the urgency of this transaction as we have been reliably informed that it will take at least two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you so we decided it is best using the email let me start by first introducing myself properly to you i am dr osaro ame a director general in the ministry of mines and power and i head a threeman tender board appointed by the government of the federal republic of nigeria to award contracts to individuals and companies and to approve such contract payments in the ministry of mines and power the duties of the committee also include evaluation vetting and monitoring of work done by both foreign and local contractors in the ministry i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence in order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said funds the source of this funds is as follows between and this committee awarded contracts to various contractors for engineering procurement supply of electrical equipments such as transformers and some rural electrification projects however these contracts were overinvoiced by the committee thereby leaving the sum of usmillion dollars eleven million five hundred thousand united states dollars in excess this was done with the intention that the committee will share the excess when the payments are approved the federal government have since approved the total contract sum which has been paid out to the companies and contractors concerned which executed the contracts leaving the balance of m dollars which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe offshore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst ourselves we need your assistance as the funds are presently secured in an escrow account of the federal government specifically set aside for the settlement of outstanding payments to foreign contractors we are handicapped in this circumstances as the civil service code of conduct does not allow us to operate offshore accounts hence your importance in the whole transaction is highly needed my colleagues and i have agreed that if you or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf you

once upon a time daniel wrote what do you pleople think of the strategy to put prerelease alphabetarc information in the release field the above example should then have alpha as versionrelease and when the final version was released it would have why not its just that sometimes it gets a bit more confusing in the spec file since you have to change the source as well as setup to reflect the name changes but it might also sometimes be even easier the way you suggest if the entire package contains only references to the final version and that only the archive name has a pr or beta in it for example take for instance xmame ive been packaging prereleases as frx since the entire source has only tags everywhere no preversion tags whatsoever still i dont think epoch is an evil hack although its true that it may cause problems between distributions when used wanting to avoid it when possible is a good thing indeed matthias matthias saou world trade center edificio norte planta system and network engineer barcelona spain electronic group interactive phone _______________________________________________ rpmlist mailing list rpmlistfreshrpmsnet

this contest expires in nine days august source planet ark cooler tokyo summers may be just a pipe dream away by elaine lies japan august tokyo in what could be the ultimate in public works projects a japanese panel of experts has proposed relieving the misery of steamy tokyo summers by cooling the huge city with sea water and a labyrinth of underground pipes though summers are hard in any city tokyos narrow streets hordes of people and clusters of massive skyscrapers largely unrelieved by greenery produce a special brand of discomfort and it gets worse every year oh yeah you bet it does the number of nights when temperatures stay above celsius fahrenheit in tokyo has doubled over the last years while average temperatures have shot up by degrees c over the last century relief however distant could be on the way great news weather sufferers we live in the hightech capital of a g state at the behest of the construction ministry the panel has drawn up a plan that would use a network of buried pipes and water pumped from the sea to cool things down in the very best conditions certain areas could in theory become as much as degrees celsius cooler said yujin minobe a ministry planner the huge airconditioning systems currently used to cool buildings get rid of the heat they take out of the structure by venting it into the outside air raising temperatures still further and creating a heat island phenomenon in large cities soon whole cities will do it and vent their heat straight into the rising seas look out antarctica under the plan this heat would be transferred to water in large underground tanks and the water then pumped through a sixkm mile network of underground pipes to a cooling plant on the tokyo waterfront there the heat from this water would be transferred to cooler sea water before the thencooled water was pumped back through the underground pipes the sea water now warmed would be released into the waters of tokyo bay costly plan thats unsurprising minobe said the plan would cover some hectares acres in the centre of tokyo including the marunouchi business district and the posh ginza shopping area and would initially cost around billion yen million savings on reduced energy usage would eventually help pay for this he said a real nest of ironies here folks officials quoted in the englishlanguage japan times said energy savings would total more than billion yen a year meaning the system would pay for itself in a bit over years however minobe said many problems remained with the plan which has only been under discussion since april last year one of the most serious problems is whether warmer water being returned to tokyo bay would damage the fragile marine ecosystem a point minobe said still required more study give it years and there wont be any ecosystem left to study he said the average temperature cut is likely to be only around degrees im not even sure people would be able to feel that difference he said any such plan however would likely produce a gleam in the eyes of japans huge construction industry known for its propensity for public works projects although several are decried as wasteful public works projects have long been used by the government in attempts to stimulate the economy nice use of the word attempts frankly i think this plan is still really more of a dream than anything else minobe said oco oco oco oco tokyo stays cool as deadly heatwave bakes kobe osaka kyoto oco oco oco oco

you have multiple generations of peasantssquatters that cultivate and live on the lands almost as a human parts of the property package when id read that getting legal title can take years when i believe that year ought to be more than sufficient and helped by the cairo reference id assumed that we were talking about the urban poor if i see people living in mansions or even in suburban subdivisions i assume they didnt have too much trouble with their titles if i see people living in shanties and haphazard alleyways i tend to assume their parcels werent exactly recorded on the government maps or paid for with a bank loan especially when nearby vacant lots have shotgun wielding men presumably intent on keeping them development free now it may be that manhattanites view of america to say that outside of metro manila davao and maybe another city or two cebu everything else literally is the boondocks but going on that very broad assumption i guess im describing the flip side of mr rogers experience the paisanos who leave behind those who remain on a patrons rural land move to manila and the second assumption squat in shantytowns there at least until they can line up a middleclass job so going on two large assumptions i can come up with a scenario under which title would take years a shantytown arises somewhere in the midst of a section or whatever the spanish used to divvy up the land and it takes decades of arguing to put together a package which somehow can both compensate the owner and record lots for the inhabitants just transferring title to an existing lot between parties who have money ought not to be a problem the obvious solution at least to us barking farting chihuahuas on fork is to introduce market mechanisms it is left as an exercise to come up with one which works when many of the agents are perceived to have negligible npv dave land reform meant that all the agricultural producers had to plant crops all the time profitable or not what happened to more highlycapitalized land putting in trees instead of crops sounds like it might sidestep that mr long i think youd particularly enjoy the de soto work on the to find list any chance of an explanation of that bell jar in the meantime

hello bill monday september pm you wrote mf i dont think free speech is a license to speak directly at and be in the mf physical presence of any particular individual of your choosing especially mf when that individual is busy doing something else and isnt interested bs yep i agree sure and that goes back to my second argument cohen they can walk away nobody compells them to stand there ill agree fully but we still have a constitutional right to speak out against policies actions and grievances again if you want it another way lets change the constitution bs huh are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard bs shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship if bs shouting down public speakers is protected it is only a matter of time bs before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against bs them every single time they open their mouth the tactic is stupid and bs nonproductive and if generally used will only result in chaos the tactic bs is just stupid egobation at best unless the goal is to generate chaos bs and humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society bs should be locked up provided you can accurately identify them which is not bs really possible anyway but hey this is my rant imho bs bill no offense or anything but theres a difference between holding a sign that doesnt agree with bush and screaming at him my sole point as far as the st amendment goes is that there is more to this game than just being an angry liberal youth which is the gross culmination of everyones argument sofar the screaming isnt the most effective method around i dont believe i argued that it was but screaming is happening because the means to communicate to the representatives involved are diminishing at least as far as the people doing the screaming are concerned for the record i dont support the screamers in organized conferences such as the colin powell shoutdown that was mentioned earlier i dont think that this is what the st amendment was implying these folks do have a right to be heard and i think they have a right to be heard by the folks they elected in the first place my point my only point was really more concerned with the cases such as mr nell he wasnt engaged at least from the limited facts we have in a shoutout but rather in a difference of opinion he has a right to possess this opinion and make it known to the representatives that are elected a sign is not a shoutout i think i may have missed or not accurately addressed the original thread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming dissenters to the mix i was mostly responding with my miffedness in having broadbrush strokes applied to a group without examining the policy reasons that might have contributed to it in this case the screaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from the folks they need to speak with theyre resorting to creative offensive and constitutionally challengable means but its not simply due to the fact that theyre and have lost all decorum the my generation never did this is all bs theres more to this story we just dont know it all i hope this clarifies my position for the quick rehash screaming free speech on all cases dissent free speech provided you follow what has been laid down by the supremes k best regards bitbitch mailtobitbitchmagnesiumnet

not the computer game but wednesday july gmt uk space rock on collision course an asteroid could devastate earth by dr david whitehouse bbc news online science editor an asteroid discovered just weeks ago has become the most threatening object yet detected in space a preliminary orbit suggests that nt is on an impact course with earth and could strike the planet on february although the uncertainties are large astronomers have given the object a rating on the socalled palermo technical scale of threat of making nt the first object to be given a positive value from its brightness astronomers estimate it is about two kilometres wide large enough to cause continentwide devastation on earth many observations although astronomers say the object definitely merits attention they expect more observations to show it is not on an earthintersecting trajectory this asteroid has now become the most threatening object in the short history of asteroid detection dr benny peiser it was first seen on the night of july picked up by the linear observatorys automated sky survey programme in new mexico us since then astronomers worldwide have been paying close attention to it amassing almost observations in a few weeks could it be deflected dr benny peiser of liverpool john moores university in the uk told bbc news online that this asteroid has now become the most threatening object in the short history of asteroid detection nt circles the sun every days and travels in a tilted orbit from about the distance of mars to just within the earths orbit potential devastation detailed calculations of nts orbit suggest many occasions when its projected path through space intersects the earths orbit researchers estimate that on february its impact velocity on the earth would be km a second enough to wipe out a continent and cause global climate changes however dr peiser was keen to point out that future observations could change the situation he said this unique event should not diminish the fact that additional observations in coming weeks will almost certainly we hope eliminate the current threat easily observable according to astronomers nt will be easily observable for the next months or so meaning there is no risk of losing the object observations made over that period and the fact that nt is bright enough that it is bound to show up in old photographs mean that scientists will soon have a very precise orbit for the object dr donald yeomans of the us space agencys nasa jet propulsion laboratory in california told bbc news online the orbit of this object is rather highly inclined to the earths orbit so it has been missed because until recently observers were not looking for such objects in that region of space regarding the possibility of an impact dr yeomans said the uncertainties were large the error in our knowledge of where nt will be on february is large several tens of millions of kilometres he said dr yeomans said the world would have to get used to finding more objects like nt that on discovery look threatening but then become harmless this is because the problem of nearearth objects is now being properly addressed he said

surely it would be faster to save you conf files install it on the box again copy back you confs and voila all you car about are the confs as the boite has no data right thats what i would do but you sysadmins have to make life as difficult complicated as possible have you thought about mirroring the system drives might save you serious hassle down the line only kidding but thats what i would do cw ok heres how to do it while the disk is still installed in the i machine if thats broken beg borrow or steal remove the i versions of glibc and kernel and install the i versions this will break one or two other packages since they have entries in etcldsoconf which belongs to glibc these packages will need to be reinstalled so rpm e nodeps glibc your etcldsoconf has been saved as etcldsoconfrpmsave rpm ivh glibcvernoirpm rpm e nodeps kernel rpm ivh kernelvernoirpm this installs the i versions of kernel and glibc youll be able to boot in a non machine now however x is now broken as is kerberos at least those are the two i noticed your etcldsoconfrpmsave will contain clues as to what else might be broken to fix x and kerberos you need to reinstall their libs copying etcldsoconfrpmsave back to etcldsoconf doesnt seem to work rpm ivh replacepkgs xfreelibsvernoirpm rpm ivh replacepkgs krblibsvernoirpm fixes them other libs listed in _my_ etcldsoconf are qt mysql and sane if they start behaving in odd fashions it may be related reinstalling the libs for these packages may fix that thanks guys snip i wouldnt bog it down with x either thats a thought but it may be useful for the server to be available as a user machine also maybe staff only maybew admin only in any case the local admin who doesnt exist as yet will probably be using gui tools rather than cli ones well yes it could be running lovely gui tools as well though are you sure you want to have them available most of the ones ive seen are better of to be put down id rather then be using webmin for day to day maintenance and give the local admins just a restricted set of things they can do with it like adding and removing users and the likes then the dangerous parts of the admining side can be hidden away from their prying hands true they can always break into it since they have physical access to it as well on the other hand it would be better if they contacted yourself for the remaining admin tasks since i believe this was supposed to be remotely administered by yourself iirc since this thing will be on a sub k dialup any remote admin will be strictly of the emergency variety i plan to have the server mail me its logs and stuff regurlarly so i can keep an eye on it but mostall of the admin will be done locally conor it being migrate a hard disk from an intel pceleron box to an amd kx box essentially the pceleron processor is an i class while the amd k processor is an i class not sure about the amd athlon or duron chips a rhl installed on the i class machine will not boot on an i calss box since both kernel and glibc are optimised for i the solution is to replace the i kernel and glibc with i versions conor daly met eireann glasnevin hill dublin ireland ph fax bofhirmetie running redhat linux am up days users load average this email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and intended solely for the use of the individual or entity to whom they are addressed if you have received this email in error please notify the system manager this footnote also confirms that this email message has been swept for the presence of computer viruses irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

on aug daniel quinlan wrote dan kohn dandankohncom writes daniel its easy enough for you to change the habeas scores yourself on your installation if habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to nonspammers and to place all violators on the hil then i have no doubt that justin and craig will quickly remove us from the next release but youre trying to kill habeas before it has a chance to show any promise i think ive worked on sa enough to understand that i can localize a score im just not comfortable with using spamassassin as a vehicle for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base i have to agree here if habeas is going to die just because sa does not support it thats a serious problem with the business model but that is nobodys problem but habeass a possible solution is for habeass business model to include some kind of incentive for users of sa to give it the benefit of the doubt i have yet to think of an incentive that fits the bill on thu aug justin mason wrote i dont see a problem supporting it in spamassassin but i see dans points high score as far as i can see thats because spamassassin is assigning such high scores to legit newsletters these days and the habeas mark has to bring it down below that imo we have to fix the highscorers anyway no spam ever needs to score over in our scoring system tagged anyway this is off the topic of the rest of this discussion but amavisd in all its incarnations and mimedefang and several other mta plugins all reject at smtp time messages that scores higher than some threshold often if some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than thered better be _zero_ fps because all those filters would drop their thresholds to on thu aug michael moncur wrote but i agree that there needs to be more focus on eliminating rules that frequently hit on newsletters if any newsletters actually use the habeas mark that will be one way to help newsletters wont use the mark habeas is priced way too high a factor of at least over what the market will bear imo on a permessage basis for most typical mailing lists lockergnome say to afford it on thu aug harold hallikainen wrote habeus has come up with a very clever way to use existing law to battle spam it seems that at some point they could drop the licensing fee to or less and make all their income off suing the spammers for copyright infringement sorry that just cant work if the habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in nonspam and effectivelyenforced enough to be absent from spam such that eg sa could assign a positive score to messages that do not have it then spammers are out of business and habeas has no one to sue theres nobody left to charge except the people who want or are forced against their will because their mail wont get through otherwise to use the mark conversely if there are enough spammers forging the mark for habeas to make all its income suing them then the mark is useless for the purpose for which it was designed either way it seems to me that after maybe a couple of lawsuits against real spammers and a lot of ceaseanddesist letters to clueless mompops then either a theyre out of business b they have to sell the rights to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders or c theyve both created and monopolized a market for internet postage stamps that everybody has to pay them for the latter would be quite a coup if they could pull it off they do absolutely nothing useful unless you consider threatening people with lawsuits useful yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly from everyone on the internet effectively well be paying them for the privilege of policing their trademark for them i dont believe theyll ever get that far but i dont particularly want to help them make it and i use the term they loosely because the whole company could consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point this sfnet email is sponsored bythinkgeek welcome to geek heaven _______________________________________________ spamassassintalk mailing list spamassassintalklistssourceforgenet

hi all ive run into a fairly intractable for me problem and was wondering if anybody could give me pointers on how to deal with it i am running debian woody on a pentium iii ide based system i have a ricoh a ide cd rewriter which i use using cdrecord and the scsi over ide kernel modules i was running kernel until probably last weekend when i noticed was out downloaded patch and installed new kernel with no real problems this morning i went to burn a cdrom and the system locked hard rebooting into allowed cdburning to work fine this problem is very reproducible on my system at least the cdrecord command i was using was cdrecord v speed blankfast dev data bakiso the blanking appears to go ok but when it tries to write data it just locks up the entire system cant ping it from outside even afaics the system just stops hard reset is only way back in and when it does reboot i can not see anything useful in any logfiles varlogmessages varlogkernlog varlogsyslog at any rate cdrecord scanbus works fine and reports the two pseudoscsi devices my cdr drive and my cdrw the same lock occurs even if there is no blanking i tried upgrading to preac on assumption that if there was a kernel issue it might have been fixed in these patches but it gives the same error i also downloaded and compiled the source for cdrecord and installed it instead of the debian package i was wondering if maybe there was some compile option the packager had used which maybe would cause the problem and still the problem persisted anyway im completely stumped google searching has not done me much good and im a little bit lost what id like to know is a how to fix the problem b is this likely to be an application or kernel problem the severity of the crash would make me suspect it is a kernel problem but im not very knowledgeable on these things c should i post a description of this to the kernel mailing list if this is an appropriate course of action are there any tips beyond the guidelines on kernelorg like i said im lost on this one so any info is very gratefully received mick michael conry ph web key fingerprint b c a cb b de c irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

oh well uh thank you russell lol i think c on sat sep russell turpin wrote robert harley it is perfectly obvious that heterosexual promiscuity is exactly precisely identical between males and females yeah assuming approximately equal populations but that obscures the different modes of promiscuity both the person who gives sex for money or power or companionship and the person who uses money and power and companionship to get sex are promiscuous in the broadest sense of the word but their motives and behavior are quite different langur monkeys were the example in the cited article dominant males kill babies that are not their own the dominant male monkey seeks to defend his harem of females but cozying up to the current dominant male isnt the best strategy for female langurs because dominant males are dethroned by rivals every months or so by mating with as many extragroup males as possible female langurs ensure their offspring against infanticide by the male who is likely next to rule the roost maybe its just me but that doesnt paint a picture of carefree females engaged in joyously promiscuous couplings the dom cab driver who is taking her two boy toys to new orleans is a better picture of that _________________________________________________________________ chat with friends online try msn messenger i dont take no stocks in mathematics anyway huckleberry finn

it works fine now that the sound card is removed but im still confused as to why this worked in but not seems like a regression to me thanks again cheers al strange i had the double irq problem with the c combo and turning pnp off in the cards firware fixed it as far as i remember the problem i was having was that the driver was assigning an irq to the cards rj port and then another irq to its bnc port and then referenced the card via the second assigned irq and turning off pnp in the cards firmware fixed that you must be having a different error else pnp is still turned on obvious suggestion entails making sure the irq and io space you assign the card in its firmware is not in use by any other isa devices irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

ive been playing with an old dell optiplex and decided to attempt to build a pentiummmx optimised linux on it to start i installed the bare minimum debian system for compiling programs next i built a custom kernel since most cpu optimizations are best suited to the kernel code next i built x from sources especially since x make a lot of use of matrixes and can also benifit from mmx optimizations since the first build ive been encouraged to play with the cvs of both xfree and the dri stuff so i will be rebuilding x once we get some bugs worked out finally i built kdebeta from sources i had again to take full advantage of the mmx processor can anyone recommend other minimum tools that i should rebuild to get even more improvements in system performance i know that not all packages can or do benefit from being built on pentiummmx rather than the i that debian compiles to but have i covered everything that can benefit i am wondering if the c and other libraries should be rebuilt can they take advantage of the pentium and mmx instructions for system performance and would this require rebuilding gcc as well i realise that not everything can benefit from recompiling ie i doubt i would see much system improvement if i recompile bash but things like the kernel x and kde should improve performance on a related note i know ive mentioned here before but im still looking for a slot mhz piii my regular system is a dual pii and the bx mb can take piiis i managed to get my hands on one if i could get another i could put the two piiis into this box and recompile x to use the ssekatmai instructions in the piii i just dont thing it is worth replacing two piis with one piii i know that they are outofstock and i do watch the buynsell regularly but short of buying a full piii system ive not had much luck cheers john gay irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

just as the pyramids of egypt were built in honour of great kings it was fitting that sandy replicas were created on weymouth beach in memory of the king of the castle fred darrington who became the worlds most famous sand sculptor died last week aged his grandson mark anderson who has taken over his dorset seafront pitch is determined that his grandfathers name will not be forgotten despite the impermanence of his creations can someone please tell me what a pitch constitutes i have an idea it is somewhat like the spots street musicians claim but this sounds more formal just an area of the beach by the prom where hes allowed to make his sculptures weymouth is where i spent my teenage years my mum and one sister still live there so im pretty familiar with the sculptures pretty impressive and very big i think he uses some sort of armature for some bits its not just sand they usually get vandalised though after a lot of drinks it obviously is a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits then again weymouth is pretty run down and attracts holiday makers of the worst sort yahoo groups sponsor dvds free sp join now to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteanaunsubscribeegroupscom your use of yahoo groups is subject to

this is not directly spamassassin related but more of a general dealingwithspam issue what is the best way to deal with spam during the smtp transaction there are domains and addresses that i know are spam at the mail from and can deal with at the smtp level i have been and i think most people respond with a code a permanent error that pretty much means dont bother to try from that address again youll get the same error people often add cathartic messages to accompany the like spammers must die but this might not be the best way to go you are telling the spammers that you are on to them this may cause them to try other methods to get around your blocks is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail that is act like everything is ok during the smtp transaction but then just drop the mail into the bitbucket this is generally how spamassassin works since almost everyone uses it after the smtp transaction has completed successfully spammer thinks everything is going fine and has no reason to try new methods then there is a third possibility instead of returning a code indicating youre on to the spammer fake a response which is saying mailbox does not exist this would be in the hopes that some spammers out there actually remove names reported as nonexistent from their lists i know a slim hope but even if only a few do it can lower the incidence so what are the arguments for each do spammers even look at _any_ of the bounce messages they get the volume of bounces must be huge personally im starting to think blackholes are the way to go but sending back that spammer die die die or stock access deenied my ephasis added message can be pretty satisfying crist j clark cjclarkalummitedu cjclarkjhuedu cjcfreebsdorg in remembrance wwwosdncom _______________________________________________ spamassassintalk mailing list spamassassintalklistssourceforgenet

bryan feir mailtobryansglcrestechca wrote of course once one player key was broken dealing with the rest became a known plaintext attack and the rest of the player keys went down like a row of dominos the actual followup to the xing player break was more interesting than that the mere knowledge of known plaintext a corresponding input and output does not necessarily make it trivial to break a properly designed systems andor algorithm the primary reason it was easy for css is because the css key was only bits and thereby easy to break with exhaustive search attacks it was only bits speculated because of a misunderstanding of the government cryptography export rules at the time even more interesting to me at least was that soon after the xing player break people started studying the css algorithm itself they rapidly found serious design flaws which left the bit css algorithm with an actual strength of around bits from memory and new attacks might have further reduced the strength this is another great example showing why proprietary cryptography algorithms should be viewed with the greatest of suspicion on tue sep at pm yannick gingras wrote this make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards they have an internal procession unit around mhz can we consider them as trusted hardware yes and no you can put a limited amount of trust in a smart card there have been any number of very clever attacks against smartcards ross anderson in the uk has documented quite a few of these and smartcard manufactures are usually one step behind these attacks a well designed system assumes that a system smartcard will be completely compromised at some point giving an adversary all of the secrets contained in the smartcard the cryptography industry has developed a variety of techniques that can reduce the impact of a compromise including unique keys per smartcard and forward security techniques luciano rocha strangenskyiorg wrote the problem is that that piece of hardware is trustworthy but the rest of the pc isnt so a cracker just needs to simulate the locksmart card or peek at the executable after the lock has been deactivated going back to the original question once the encrypted material goes outside the trusted hardware it is impossible to unbreakably protect it there may be some mitigation steps you can take such as the sdmi watermarking but most schemes to date have been easily broken another consideration is the value of what you are trying to protect while there is no such thing as unbreakable adding more cost both in terms of price and hasslefactor can greatly improve the protection since you are talking about the use of standard pc workstations i presume what you are trying to protect is not that valuable im afraid most security measures dont come for free michael mckay director of software development mmckayiscubedcom information security systems services inc stevens creek blvd cupertino ca phone x fax wwwiscubedcom

i am trying to secure three of four virtual hostnames on our apache server we are not taking credit card orders or users personal information but are merely hoping to secure email and calendar web transactions for our users we are not running any secure applications on the root host i have been testing this week with ca client and host certificate requests certificates and keys and think i have a fairly good beginners grasp of the commands and command line options my questions are is it necessary to create a ca certificate for each of the secure virtual hosts or can one ca certificate for the root be used to sign each of the keys for all three common names we are trying to secure even though the root host is not conducting secure transactions am i correct in configuring the server with a cacertificatefile in the main body of and then setting the cacertificatefile for each virtual host in the virtual section of this sort of assumes the answer to is you need a ca for each virtual host is it necessary to create a client certificate to distribute to our users or is it sufficient to have the ca certificate and a server certificate for the virtual hosts wouldnt a client certificate only be necessary if we were trying to verify the clients identity would that be a good idea given our scenario thanks in advance for your help ______________________________________________________________________ openssl project user support mailing list opensslusersopensslorg automated list manager majordomoopensslorg

rohit khare wrote why am i so passionate about decentralization because i believe some of todays most profound problems with networked applications are caused by centralization generically a centralized political or economic system permits only one answer to a question while decentralization permits many separate agents to hold different opinions of the same matter in the specific context of software centralized variables can only contain one valid value at a time that limits us to only representing information a according to the beliefs of a single agency and b that changes more slowly than it takes to propagate nevertheless centralization is the basis for todays most popular architectural style for developing network applications clientserver interaction using requestresponse communication protocols i think the ability to maintain an inconsistent database is key to decentralization databases enforce consistenty with every transaction bounded transactions like an atm enforce consistency by have some play with time and value most people keep inconsistent data in their heads its called congnitive dissonance theory most businesses keep inconsistent data documents tationale and ideas to support their work activities its called real life i dont think it matters so much where its located ie decentralization i think that decentralization is the workaround from technical limitations the fallout being that the only way inconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by protecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries the local information when combined with the technical troubles of providing just enough forced synchronization to remote information provide workable data consistenty ie enforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when concerns are more immedidate tolerating temporary irreconcilable deviations is how people cope otherwise youd be like nick gatsby unnecessarily preoccupied with a spot of shaving cream on mckees neck who thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the whole world would be a little more perfect and everything including his preoccupation with daisy would consistently be in its proper place greg

whats wrong with doing business over the web web forms theres promising replacements forms but this is the current state of the industry o you find something that you want to fill out its a partnership form a signup for a web seminar a request for more information anything o you start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend about minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops just to get a small piece of information whitepaper or a callback when halfway through you start to wonder if its really worth your time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list o pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized i was on a site just now that had every single country in the world listed the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you to hit submit but due to the layout the more tag on the second row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except about two dozen third world countries o even worse ever time you hit submit all forms based things complain about using the universal country phone number format and will cause you to reenter dashes instead of dots o when you get something thats not entered right you will go back and enter it right but then some other field or most likely pulldown will automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to go back and resent that freaking thing too finally after all combinations of all pulldowns you may get a successful submit o you wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation o sometimes like today you wont be able to ever submit anything due to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that is internally nonconflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their forms submission whats wrong with this picture the company is screwing you by wasting your time enforcing their data collection standards on you im sure theres someone in that company that would be willing to accept us us usa united states u of a america etc and would know exactly which freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them to waste even more time playing web form geography im starting to see the light of passport you want more information hit this passport button voila ie and netscape have preforms sutff but i always turn it off because you never know when theres that one field that you dont want to submit to the person you are submitting to that automatically gets sent ie the privacy stuff is well beyond the average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff so if crappy formsbased submission is the state of practice for business enablement on the web i cant see this whole data submission and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process as working all that well greg

hi everybody im writing a web application in java tomcat jspservlets database access with postgresql this will be released under the gpl and will eventually be useful as a framework for other web applications the application main focus is ecommerce but not limited to that i would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the database but i have some problem figuring out the right approach above all how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server a problem that i was unable to solve is how to store keys for encryptiondecryption the api that im using is the jca jdkx and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always i can serialize the object and store in the database but this is not the most secure approach this key is needed to decrypt data in the database but the database is accessible from the web application assuming that i can find a good and secure place where to store the database password i can use a different database with different user argh to complex and doesnt really solve the problem where i can found good documentation about this topic there is another approach that i would share with the list something i thought that can be of bit interest but probabily wrong and insecure after all im a real beginner in secure programming and im here to learn methods and technics first of all i need a secure way to keep database passwords secure so i have to keep them separate from the main server the right approach could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user not tomcat so it is not shared with other web services or worst the nobody user that has no shell login but has a default home directory or a place where it can hold passwords and keys the web application could then open an ssl connection could be done in the init method at server startup to get database passwords the small bean could check via code signaturermiwhatever else that the source is the right one and handle all the database connections or give the db connectionpassword to the main web application in this way we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in shared directories and also an attacker should get rootbean user account to read data this is not perfect and works only if your provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java application that means really another server running in the background any suggestions thank you mario torre please avoid sending me word or powerpoint attachments see

on wed jul at am marty halvorson wrote a forest service official has stated flat out that the tree lovers need to understand their responsibility in contributing to the number of uncontrollable ie crown fires caused by very dense tree stands and under growth fires by their suits to stop any tree removal from the forests managed by the forest service boy that is rather strange ive always been under the impression that the uncontrollable forest fires were the result of the forest services longstanding am policy in place until the decision in to switch over to letitburn the am policy was based on theories about forest management from europe and wasnt as applicable to the american wilds so we went from a policy of containment for years to one of letting things burn unless they directly threatened property years after the end of the containment policy there is still a lot of stuff left to burn i cant imagine that artificially planted replacement forests with dense stands of identical trees help that much either i would be comfortable laying the fault for these contributing factors squarely with the forest service i would put the blame for many burned homes upon the people who chose to build their dwelling with an unwise combination of materials location and landscaping njl

on fri jul at pm john gay wrote a while ago i asked what other packages i should optomize for pentium one person answered glibc this got me thinking about gcc itself so i asked on another list and got a few answers most were dont even think about it but a few suggested gcc and one pointed me to linux from scratch why or more specifically what do you mean on one hand you can optimise how gcc is compiled all that will do is make it generate the exact same code just a smidge faster and since gcc is such a memory pig youd do better to buy more ram to up your fs cache hits and to keep gccs heap out of swap on the other side you can look into patches to gcc that affect its code generation um ok but keep in mind that compiler errors suck i cant express that enough compilers should just work perfectly always doing anything that might affect that is in my opinion insane theyre hard to trace and youd better have a deep knowledge of whats going on to either report bugs to the patch developers or to fix it yourself plus my understanding is that gcc would need major changes to get large speed boosts on x chips kevin kevinsubericnet that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to forked on the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier meatspace place home than a sober one the happiness of credulity is a cheap dangerous quality gb shaw irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie

if youre using a break or similar construct in a while loop then you might want to rethink your guard condition good point i didnt think of that however that doesnt help with a case statement which imho is cleaner than using an if statement if you have a lot of branches but then again maybe that should be refactored away with polymorphism well you should consider break inside a select statement to be part of the syntax rather than a control flow modifier a _mandatory_ part of the syntax at that later kenn irish linux users group iluglinuxie for unsubscription information list maintainer listmasterlinuxie
